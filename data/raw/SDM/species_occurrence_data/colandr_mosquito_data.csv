There is a dearth of knowledge about mosquitoes feeding preferences and their role as potential vectors of haemosporidian parasites, particularly in modified habitats. During 2013–2014 we sampled mosquitoes in five different land use types within a cloud forest matrix. From a total of 4107 adult mosquitoes, 90 were engorged. We extracted DNA from mosquito blood-meals, abdomens, and thoraxes, which belonged to seven different species. Seventeen specimens were positive for avian Plasmodium parasites. We were able to identify the blood-meal source of 10 mosquitoes, the identified vertebrate species were: Homo sapiens (Human), Sturnira hondurensis (Bat), and Bos taurus (Cow). Our results show that Culex restuans is positive for avian malaria and it is feeding on both humans and domestic animals at urban and peri-urban habitat types, where it is also an abundant species throughout the year. Furthermore, Aedes quadrivittatus, also positive for avian malaria, is feeding on humans in the well-preserved cloud forest, where this mosquito species is highly abundant. This study is the first in Mexico to provide reference data showing generalist mosquito feeding preferences and presence of avian Plasmodium at locations with different land use types. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Abella-Medrano, C.A.; Carbó-Ramírez, P.; Ibáñez-Bernal, S.; Santiago-Alarcon, D.","","67",2018,"","Abella_2018_Blood-meal_preferences_and_avian_malaria_detection_in_mosquitoes_Diptera-_Culicidae_captured_at_different_land_use_types_within_a_neotropical_montane_cloud_forest_matrix.pdf","Wrong species ","","","","","",""

However, males are increasingly seen to exhibit mate choice for female display traits, even in species with traditional sex roles, although this continues to be an understudied aspect of sexual selection. We evaluated the role of female coloration on male mate choice decisions in the spiny-footed lizard (Acanthodactylus erythrurus), a species in which adult females show red coloration as a retained juvenile trait. Although both sexes show red tails as juveniles and subadults, only females maintain red colored tails when becoming adult; moreover, this coloration is only present at the beginning of female adulthood and becomes white after ovulation, suggesting a mating-related function. Male courtship preferences were investigated through an experimental approach, where they were offered pairs of females that differed in size (adult/subadult) and tail coloration (red/white). Male lizards preferred adult females using both visual and chemical cues and, when adult female coloration could be chosen, they preferred red females. These results suggest that red coloration is a sexual signal involved in male mate selection. We hypothesize that red coloration in adult females might indicate sexual maturity and a pre-ovulatory reproductive status. Being a juvenile trait retained until the beginning of adulthood, we also suggest that it might indicate reduced risk of sperm competition. This study highlights the role of a juvenile trait for sexual selection and adds to the understanding of the evolution of male mate choice. © The Author(s) 2017.","Belliure, J.; Cuervo, J.J.; Fresnillo, B.","","29",2018,"","","","","","","","",""

Mosquito studies in the natural environment are of considerable importance because of their role in transmitting pathogens to both humans and other vertebrates. Community diversity can have significant effects on the risk of their disease transmission. The objective of this study was to understand the distribution of mosquito communities using oviposition traps in a region of the Atlantic Forest. Sampling was carried out in Bom Retiro Private Natural Reserve (RPPNBR), located in Casimiro de Abreu, Rio de Janeiro, using oviposition traps, which were set in the forest environment, from October 2015 to December 2016. The canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess the influence of the climatic variables (precipitation, maximum dew point, and direction) throughout the seasons on the population density of the mosquito species. The results showed that population density was directly influenced by climatic variables, which acted as a limiting factor for the mosquito species studied. The climatic variables that were significantly correlated with the density of the mosquito species were precipitation, maximum dew point, and direction. Haemagogus janthinomys was positively correlated with the three climatic variables, whereas Haemagogus leucocelaenus was positively correlated with precipitation and maximum dew point, and negatively correlated with direction. © Shayenne Olsson Freitas Silva et al. 2018.","Alencar, J.; De Aguiar Maia, D.; Ferreira De Mello, C.; Figueiró, R.; Silva, S.O.F.","","18",2018,"","Alencar_2018_Distribution_of_the_Mosquito_Communities_Diptera-_Culicidae_in_Oviposition_Traps_Introduced_into_the_Atlantic_Forest_in_the_State_of_Rio_de_Janeiro_Brazil_.pdf","","22° 27' 14.1'' S , 42° 17' 34.9'' W ; 22° 26' 58.7'' S , 42° 17' 11.6'' W","22° 27' 14.1'' S , 42° 17' 34.9'' W ; 22° 26' 58.7'' S , 42° 17' 11.6'' W ; 22° 27' 19.4'' S , 42° 18' 9.5'' W","N/A","d; /; m; /; s","n; o","y; e; s"

Along 3 years, the diversity and composition of mosquito species in tree holes of two neighbouring but completely different environments, a city and its adjacent forest, were compared using generalized linear mixed models, PERMANOVA, SIMPER and species association indexes. The city area (Northwest Argentina) is highly relevant epidemiologically due to the presence of Aedes aegypti L. (main dengue vector) and occurrence of dengue outbreaks; the Yungas rainforests are highly biologically diverse. In total seven mosquito species were recorded, in descending order of abundance: Ae. aegypti, Haemagogus spegazzinii Brèthes, Sabethes purpureus (Theobald), Toxorhynchites guadeloupensis Dyar and Knab, Aedes terrens Walker, Haemagogus leucocelaenus Dyar & Shannon and Sabethes petrocchiae (Shannon and Del Ponte). The seven mosquito species were recorded in both city sites and forested areas; however, their mosquito communities significantly diverged because of marked differences in the frequency and relative abundance of some species: Tx. guadeloupensis and Ae. aegypti were significantly more abundant in forest and urban areas, respectively. Positive significant associations were detected between Ae. aegypti, Hg. spegazzinii and Hg. leucocelaenus. The combined presence of Ae. aegypti, Haemagogus and Sabethes in the area also highlight a potential risk of yellow fever epidemics.

During the last 60 years, more than 30 epidemics and over half a million clinical cases attributed to OROV infection have been reported in Brazil, Peru, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago. OROV fever is considered the second most frequent arboviral febrile disease in Brazil after dengue fever. OROV is transmitted through both urban and sylvatic transmission cycles, with the primary vector in the urban cycle being the anthropophilic biting midge Culicoides paraensis. Currently, there is no evidence of direct human-to-human OROV transmission. OROV fever is usually either undiagnosed due to its mild, self-limited manifestations or misdiagnosed because its clinical characteristics are similar to dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever, including malaria as well. At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment, and in the absence of a vaccine for effective prophylaxis of human populations in endemic areas, the disease prevention relies solely on vector control strategies and personal protection measures. OROV fever is considered to have the potential to spread across the American continent and under favorable climatic conditions may expand its geographic distribution to other continents. In view of OROV’s emergence, increased interest for formerly neglected tropical diseases and within the One Health concept, the existing knowledge and gaps of knowledge on OROV fever are reviewed. © 2018 by the authors.

Ninety per cent of the global burden occurs in Africa where it is primarily transmitted by Aedes spp, with Aedes aegypti the main vector for urban yellow fever (YF). Mosquito life cycle and viral replication in the mosquito are heavily dependent on climate, particularly temperature and rainfall. We aimed to assess whether seasonal variations in climatic factors are associated with the seasonality of YF reports. Methodology/Principal findings: We constructed a temperature suitability index for YFV transmission, capturing the temperature dependence of mosquito behaviour and viral replication within the mosquito. We then fitted a series of multilevel logistic regression models to a dataset of YF reports across Africa, considering location and seasonality of occurrence for seasonal models, against the temperature suitability index, rainfall and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as covariates alongside further demographic indicators. Model fit was assessed by the Area Under the Curve (AUC), and models were ranked by Akaike’s Information Criterion which was used to weight model outputs to create combined model predictions. The seasonal model accurately captured both the geographic and temporal heterogeneities in YF transmission (AUC = 0.81), and did not perform significantly worse than the annual model which only captured the geographic distribution. The interaction between temperature suitability and rainfall accounted for much of the occurrence of YF, which offers a statistical explanation for the spatio-temporal variability in transmission. Conclusions/Significance: The description of seasonality offers an explanation for heterogeneities in the West-East YF burden across Africa. Annual climatic variables may indicate a transmission suitability not always reflected in seasonal interactions. This finding, in conjunction with forecasted data, could highlight areas of increased transmission and provide insights into the occurrence of large outbreaks, such as those seen in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Brazil. © 2018 Hamlet et al.","Biey, J.; Ferguson, N.; Garske, T.; Hamlet, A.; Jean, K.; Perea, W.; Van Kerkhove, M.; Yactayo, S.","","12",2018,"","","","","","","","",""

In agreement with the criteria of Integrated Vector Management, several research efforts have been devoted to develop behavior-based control tools to fight mosquito vectors. However, our knowledge of mosquito mating biology and sexual communication is still patchy. Despite the high relevance of C. pipiens as a vector of medical and veterinary importance, no studies on its mating behavior and the factors routing mating success have been conducted. In this study, I quantified the mating behavior of an Italian strain of C. pipiens, evaluating the male mating success and its potential connections with population-level lateralized traits occurring during the mating sequence. Mean copula duration exceeded 100 s. Courting males can be straightly accepted by the female after the first genital contact (38.95%), as well as after some rejection kicks performed by females with hind legs (17.89%). No copula duration differences were detected between these two cases. The overall male mating success in laboratory conditions was 56.84%. The females performing rejection kicks preferentially used right hind legs at population-level. This was confirmed over four subsequent testing phases. The number of kicks per rejection event and the rejection success were higher when right legs are used over left ones, showing a functional advantage linked with the employ of right legs. Overall, the present study represents the first quantification of the courtship and mating behavior of C. pipiens. Data on male mating success and the role population-level lateralized mating traits provides basic biological knowledge that can be helpful to optimize autocidal and behavior-based control tools. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Benelli, G.","","179",2018,"","","","","","","","",""

We employed a Bayesian phylogeography approach to characterize the emergence of recombinants in Brazil and Haiti and report evidence in favor of the putative role of human mobility in facilitating recombination among MAYV strains from geographically distinct regions. Spatiotemporal characteristics of recombination events and the emergence of this previously neglected virus in Haiti, a known hub for pathogen spread to the Americas, warrants close monitoring of MAYV infection in the immediate future. © 2017 The Author(s).","Capua, I.; Cella, E.; Ciccozzi, M.; Dollar, J.J.; Lednicky, J.; Mavian, C.; Morris, J.G.; Prosperi, M.C.F.; Rife, B.D.; Salemi, M.","","7",2017,"","Capua_2017_Emergence_of_recombinant_Mayaro_virus_strains_from_the_Amazon_basin.1.pdf","focus on virus","","","","","",""

This conflicts with the traditional idea that females are constrained by their comparatively large investment in each offspring, and so should only need to mate once or a few times. Females may need to mate multiply to gain sufficient sperm supplies to maintain their fertility, especially in species in which male promiscuity results in division of their ejaculate among many females. Here, we take a novel approach, utilizing wild-caught individuals to explore how natural variation among females and males influences fertility gains for females. We studied this in the Malaysian stalk-eyed fly species Teleopsis dalmanni. After an additional mating, females benefit from greatly increased fertility (proportion fertile eggs). Gains from multiple mating are not uniform across females; they are greatest when females have high fecundity or low fertility. Fertility gains also vary spatially, as we find an additional strong effect of the stream from which females were collected. Responses were unaffected by male mating history (males kept with females or in male-only groups). Recent male mating may be of lesser importance because males in many species, including T. dalmanni, partition their ejaculate to maintain their fertility over many matings. This study highlights the importance of complementing laboratory studies with data on wild-caught populations, where there is considerable heterogeneity between individuals. Future research should focus on environmental, demographic and genetic factors that are likely to significantly influence variation in individual female fecundity and fertility. © 2017 The Authors.

Epicuticular compounds (ECs) are important signalling traits in insects and show extensive variability among and within taxa. Here, we investigate whether variation in the multivariate EC profiles of two sex role-reversed beetle species, Megabruchidius dorsalis and Megabruchidius tonkineus, predicts mate attractiveness and mating success in males and females. The two species had highly distinct EC profiles and both showed significant sexual dimorphism in ECs. Age and mating status in both species were also distinguishable by EC profile. Males and females of both species showed significant association between their EC profile and attractiveness, measured both as latency to mating and as success in mate-choice trials. Remarkably, the major multivariate vector describing attractiveness was correlated in both species, both sexes, and in both choice and no-choice experiments such that increased attractiveness was in all cases associated with a similar multivariate modification of EC composition. Furthermore, in both sexes this vector of attractiveness was associated with more male-like EC profiles, as well as those characterizing younger and nonvirgin individuals, which might reflect a general preference for individuals of high condition in both sexes. Despite significant sexual selection on EC composition, however, we found no support for the proposition that sexual selection is responsible for divergence in ECs between these species. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

In this context, it is necessary to evaluate vector diversity, infection rates, and spatial distribution, to better understand disease transmission dynamics. This information may contribute to the planning and development of vector control strategies. Results: A total of 778 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in fifteen localities of Córdoba from August 2015 to October 2016. Six species were identified and overall, Anopheles albimanus was the most widespread and abundant species (83%). Other species of the Nyssorhynchus subgenus were collected, including Anopheles triannulatus (13%), Anopheles nuneztovari (1%), Anopheles argyritarsis (< 1%) and two species belonging to the Anopheles subgenus: Anopheles pseudopunctipennis (3%) and Anopheles neomaculipalpus (< 1%). Four species were found naturally infected with two Plasmodium species: Anopheles nuneztovari was detected naturally infected with Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles pseudopunctipennis with Plasmodium vivax, whereas An. albimanus and An. triannulatus were found infected with both parasite species and confirmed by nested PCR. Conclusions: In general, the obtained results were contrasting with previous studies in terms of the most abundant and widespread collected species, and regarding infection rates, which were higher than those previously reported. A positive relationship between mosquito local abundance at the locality level and human infection at the municipality level was found. Mosquito local abundance and the number of houses with mosquitoes in each village are factors explaining malaria human cases in these villages. The obtained results suggest that other factors related to the apparent variation in malaria eco-epidemiology in northern Colombia, must be identified, to provide health authorities with better decision tools aiming to design control and prevention strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Atencia, M.C.; González, C.; León, C.; Molina, A.G.; Ortiz, M.; Paz, A.; Rondón, S.; Salcedo, N.; Tovar, C.","","16",2017,"","","","","","","","",""

Although yellow fever has nearly vanished from North and Central America, there are still 13 countries in the Americas considered endemic by the World Health Organization. Human cases usually occur as a result of the exposure to sylvatic yellow fever in tropical forested environments; but urban outbreaks reported during the last decade demonstrate that the risk in this environment still exists. The objective of this study was to identify spatial patterns and the relationship between key geographic and environmental factors with the distribution of yellow fever human cases in the Americas. Methodology/Principal findings: An ecological study was carried out to analyze yellow fever human cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 2000 to 2014, aggregated by second administrative level subdivisions (counties). Presence of yellow fever by county was used as the outcome variable and eight geo-environmental factors were used as independent variables. Spatial analysis was performed to identify and examine natural settings per county. Subsequently, a multivariable logistic regression model was built. During the study period, 1,164 cases were reported in eight out of the 13 endemic countries. Nearly 83.8% of these cases were concentrated in three countries: Peru (37.4%), Brazil (28.1%) and Colombia (18.4%); and distributed in 57 states/provinces, specifically in 286 counties (3.4% of total counties). Yellow fever presence was significantly associated with altitude, rain, diversity of non-human primate hosts and temperature. A positive spatial autocorrelation revealed a clustered geographic pattern in 138/286 yellow fever positive counties (48.3%). Conclusions/Significance: A clustered geographic pattern of yellow fever was identified mostly along the Andes eastern foothills. This risk map could support health policies in endemic countries. Geo-environmental factors associated with presence of yellow fever could help predict and adjust the limits of other risk areas of epidemiological concern. © 2017 Hamrick et al.","Aldighieri, S.; Hamrick, P.N.; Leonel, D.G.; Machado, G.; Schneider, M.C.; Uriona, S.; Vilca, L.M.","","11",2017,"","","","","","","","",""

We used eggs from a female caught in the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve (REBIO-PA), located in the municipality of Silva Jardim, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The eggs have an elliptical outline with a mean length of 538.67 ± 69.89 µm and width of 157.66 ± 23.12 µm and a mean egg index of 3.42 ± 0.07 µm. The external coating of the eggs is regular, with elongated chorionic cells that vary in size, with a mean length of 13.02 µm and mean width of 6.47 µm. The cells mostly have a pentagonal shape, but some have an elliptical shape. The micropylar disc has a mean diameter of 19.8 µm, it has small irregularities in its outline, excavations at the edge with the center slightly raised and a micropyle with a diameter of 2.36 µm. Complete knowledge of the egg morphology of species through SEM is useful in correlating its fine structure with consistent non-discernible differences observed under a stereoscopic microscope, and can aid in species discrimination. SEM allows the construction of identification keys for mosquito eggs that should be useful for studies involving eggs recovered from ovitraps or debris/soil samples.

The goal of this study was to identify mosquito species potentially involved in the transmission of enzootic equine encephalitis, in relation to their abundance and diversity at three endemic regions in the Repú blica de Panamá . We sampled adult mosquitoes during the dry and rainy season of Panamá . We employed CDC light traps with octanol, EV traps with CO2 and Trinidad 17 traps baited with live hamsters. Traps were deployed in the peridomicile and extradomicile of houses from 18:00 to 6:00 h. We estimated the abundance and diversity of sampled species. We collected a total of 4868 mosquitoes, belonging to 45 species and 11 genera, over 216 sampling nights. Culex (Melanoconion) pedroi, a major Venezuelan equine encephalitis vector was relatively rare (< 2.0% of all sampled mosquitoes). We also found Cx. (Mel) adamesi, Cx. (Mel) crybda, Cx. (Mel) ocossa, Cx. (Mel) spissipes, Cx. (Mel) taeniopus, Cx. (Mel) vomerifer, Aedes scapularis, Ae. angustivittatus, Coquillettidia venezuelensis, Cx. nigripalpus, Cx. declarator, Mansonia titillans, M. pseudotitillans and Psorophora ferox all species known to be vectorially competent for the transmission of arboviruses. Abundance and diversity of mosquitoes in the sampled locations was high, when compared with similar surveys in temperate areas. Information from previous reports about vectorial competence / capacity of the sampled mosquito species suggest that sampled locations have all the elements to support enzootic outbreaks of Venezuelan and Eastern equine encephalitides. © 2017 Torres et al.

The disease problem has increased in recent years, especially in urban and suburban areas of tropical and subtropical regions. There are five dengue viruses, called serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4, and DEN-5), which belong to the Flaviviridae family and are transmitted to humans through infected mosquito bites, with the main vector the Aedes aegypti mosquito (Linnaeus, 1762). Studies performed with Ae. aegypti, aimed at their identification and analysis of their population structure, are fundamental to improve understanding of the epidemiology of dengue, as well for the definition of strategic actions that reduce the transmission of this disease.

Investigating the unique mode of vector-borne transmission requires a clear understanding of the roles of vertebrates. One major obstacle to this understanding is the ambiguity of the arbovirus definition originally established by the World Health Organization. The paucity of pertinent information on arbovirus transmission at the time contributed to the notion that vertebrates played the role of reservoir in the arbovirus transmission cycle. Because this notion is a salient feature of the arbovirus definition, it is important to reexamine its validity. This review addresses controversial issues concerning vertebrate reservoirs and their role in arbovirus persistence in nature, examines the genesis of the problem from a historical perspective, discusses various unresolved issues from multiple points of view, assesses the present status of the notion in light of current knowledge, and provides options for a solution to resolve the issue. © 2017 by the author.

Male choice is often directed towards female phenotypes that are good indicators of fecundity such as body size, age, or virgin status, and often acts in the same direction as fecundity selection. In insects, only a few examples exist where male choice is directed towards female ornaments as proxies Butler of female quality. Here, we use dry season males of the sex-role reversed butterfly species Bicyclus anynana to test for differences in male choosiness and investment towards females of varying attractiveness using ornamentmanipulations. Male reproductive investment in this species is in the form of a nuptial gift, a spermatophore, given to females upon mating. Males were placed in cages with either wild-type ornamented females or with nonornamented females (center of the dorsal forewing eyespots painted over), and time to mating, duration of mating, and longevity of males and females after a single mating were measured. Ornament manipulations consisted of blocking the UV-reflective scales in the center of the dorsal forewing eyespots of females, a known sexual ornament. Males displayed lower latency to mate and longer mating durations with ornamented females. The longer mating duration did not, however, translate in the transfer of a nuptial gift that increased female longevity or reduced male longevity. Instead, we propose that longer mating durations with ornamented females may represent increased mate guarding behavior or increased sperm transfer. © 2017 The Authors.","Bhardwaj, S.; Monteiro, A.; Ng, S.Y.","","17",2017,"","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we assess vector competence of two sylvatic Neotropical mosquito species, Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Aedes terrens, to evaluate the risk of CHIKV to initiate a sylvatic cycle in the continent. Methodology/Principal findings: Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Ae. terrens from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil were orally challenged with the two CHIKV lineages circulating in the Americas. Fully engorged females were kept in incubators at 28±1°C and 70±10% humidity and examined at 3 and 7 days after virus exposure. Body (thorax plus abdomen), head and saliva samples were analyzed for respectively determining infection, dissemination and transmission. Both Hg. leucocelaenus and Ae. terrens exhibited high infection and dissemination rates with both CHIKV isolates at 7 dpi, demonstrating that they are susceptible to CHIKV, regardless of the lineage. Remarkably, Hg. leucocelaenus expectorated infectious viral particles as rapidly as 3 days after the infectious blood meal, displaying higher values of transmission rate and efficiency than Ae. terrens. Nevertheless, both species were competent to experimentally transmit both CHIKV genotypes, exhibiting vector competence similar to several American Aedes aegypti. Conclusions/Significance: These results point out the high risk for CHIKV to establish a sylvatic transmission cycle in the Americas, which could be a serious health issue as CHIKV would become another zoonotic infection difficult to control in the continent. © 2017 Lourenço-de-Oliveira, Failloux.","Failloux, A.-B.; Lourenço-de-Oliveira, R.","","11",2017,"","","","","","","","",""

In some parts of the world, the diversity is so high that the accurate delimitation and/or identification of species is challenging. A DNA-based identification system for all animals has been proposed, the socalled DNA barcoding approach. In this study, our objectives were (i) to establish DNA barcode libraries for the mosquitoes of French Guiana based on the COI and the 16S markers, (ii) to compare distance-based and tree-based methods of species delimitation to traditional taxonomy, and (iii) to evaluate the accuracy of each marker in identifying specimens. A total of 266 specimens belonging to 75 morphologically identified species or morphospecies were analyzed allowing us to delimit 86 DNA clusters with only 21 of them already present in the BOLD database. We thus provide a substantial contribution to the global mosquito barcoding initiative. Our results confirm that DNA barcodes can be successfully used to delimit and identify mosquito species with only a few cases where the marker could not distinguish closely related species. Our results also validate the presence of new species identified based on morphology, plus potential cases of cryptic species. We found that both COI and 16S markers performed very well, with successful identifications at the species level of up to 98% for COI and 97% for 16S when compared to traditional taxonomy. This shows great potential for the use of metabarcoding for vector monitoring and eco-epidemiological studies. © 2017 Talaga et al.

Larvae are typically associated with bodies of water with dense growths of aquatic vegetation, particularly Pistia stratiotes L., water lettuce. Adult females feed predominantly on the blood of birds and seek hosts in forest canopies. Aedeomyia squamipennis is considered an important vector of Gamboa virus and avian malaria, and is also suspected of transmitting Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.

Interestingly, the bright and showy sexually selected traits of some female ornaments, like those of males, might be variable and condition dependent, and hence relate to individual quality. Ultraviolet (UV)-induced fluorescence is one such ornament known to be intricately involved in intraspecific communication in several animals; however, the role of fluorescence in signalling individual quality is unknown. The ornate jumping spider, Cosmophasis umbratica, exhibits female-specific UV-induced fluorescence on its palps to facilitate effective intersex communication but whether the fluorescence informs males of the female's condition and individual quality is unknown. We tested the prediction that UV-induced fluorescence in adult female C. umbratica depended on postmaturation age, mating status and feeding regime.

Middle-aged females were brighter than younger and older females, but the older females had a greener hue; well-fed females were brighter than starved females.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that guppies can consume large numbers of larval mosquitoes. Our study investigates how intraspecific variability in guppy phenotype affects their importance as a mosquito biocontrol and how habitat conditions (natural ponds vs. water storage containers) may influence insect biomass and guppy feeding. Using a blocked experimental design, we established stream-side mesocosm ponds with half receiving gravel substrate to simulate pond-bottom habitat. To provide realistic diet choices and insect abundances, we allowed the mesocosms to colonize naturally with aquatic insect larvae for 1 month before introducing guppies. We tested two distinct guppy phenotypes (from high- and low-predation streams) alongside fish-free controls. After 1 month, we measured insect biomass in the mesocosms and examined guppy gut contents to document direct predation. While overall insect biomass was not significantly different across the three fish treatments, we observed a significant reduction in mosquito biomass in fish treatments compared to fish-free controls, as well as intraspecific differences in feeding. Overall insect biomass was significantly higher in mesocosms without gravel, while habitat condition had no effect on mosquito biomass. As guppy phenotype responds to changes in their environments, it is an important consideration for biocontrol policy to anticipate potential ecosystem effects. We close by relating our findings to other studies and by discussing the implications and potential risks of using guppies to control mosquitoes. © 2017 The Authors.

There are many vector species for Plasmodium spp. in the State of Maranhão, Brazil. In São Luís Island, Anopheles aquasalis is the main vector for human malaria; this species is abundant in areas with primates that are positive for Plasmodium. Anopheles aquasalis has natural exophilic and zoophilic feeding behavior, but in cases of high density and absence of animals, presents quite varied behavior, and feeds on human blood. In this context, the objective of the present study was to identify Plasmodium spp. and the blood meal sources of anophelines in two environmental reserves on São Luís Island, state of Maranhão, using molecular methods. Methods: Between June and July 2013, female anophelines were collected in the Sítio Aguahy Private Reserve, in the municipality of São José de Ribamar, and in the Sítio Mangalho Reserve, located within the Maracanã Environmental Protection Area, in the municipality of São Luís. CDC-type light traps, Shannon traps and protected human bait were used during three consecutive hours in peridomestic and wooded areas. Pools of anophelines were formed using mosquitoes of the same species that had been caught at the same site on the same date. A genus-specific amplification protocol based on the 18S rRNA gene was used for qPCR and cPCR. Results: A total of 416 anophelines were collected, of the following species: An. aquasalis (399), An. mediopunctatus (3), An. shannoni (1), An. nuneztovari (sensu lato) (1), An. goeldii (1), An. evansae (2) and An. (Nyssorhynchus) sp. (9), comprising 54 pools. Two pools were positive for Plasmodium (2/54) based on the 18S rRNA gene. In the phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method, based on a 240 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, it was found that the sequences of Plasmodium sp. amplified from pools of An. aquasalis (pool 2) and An. nuneztovari (s.l.) (pool 10) were phylogenetically related to a clade of P. falciparum isolates from India, and to a clade of Plasmodium sp. isolates from psittacines in Brazil, respectively. Cat, dog and human DNA were identified in the blood meals of the anophelines sampled. Conclusion: The species An. aquasalis was the most abundant anopheline species in São Luís Island. Plasmodium spp. DNA was detected, thus confirming the importance of this species as the main vector on São Luís Island, Brazil. In addition, the presence of An. nuneztovari (s.l.) with DNA positive for Plasmodium spp. confirms its importance as a secondary vector. © 2017 The Author(s).","André, M.R.; Di Santi, S.M.; Figueiredo, M.A.P.; Gonçalves, L.R.; MacHado, R.Z.; Manrique, W.G.","","10",2017,"","","","","","","","",""

Renewed interest has been recently devoted to the potential of sterile insect technique (SIT) for mosquito suppression. However, the success of the SIT is mostly dependent on the ability of sterile males to compete for mates with the wild ones in the field. Nevertheless, little is known on the sexual chemical ecology of mosquitoes, with special reference to the role of chemical signals in males. We reviewed the current knowledge on mosquito sexual chemical ecology and other key cues affecting courtship and mating behavior. The information available on the aggregation and sex pheromones in mosquito males is rather limited. To the best of our knowledge, the components of the aggregation pheromone stimulating swarming mechanisms have been fully characterized only for Aedes aegypti, while evidence for aggregation pheromones in other mosquito species remains elusive. Further research on this issue is needed, as well as to dissect the relative importance of visual (with special reference to swarming landmarks), vibrational, olfactory and tactile cues perceived during swarming and mate. On the other hand, more knowledge is available for cuticular hydrocarbons, which modulate mating behavior in several species of economic importance. These compounds, coupled with volatile aggregation components, have potential interest for the development of monitoring and trapping systems. In addition, the analyses of cuticular hydrocarbons are essential for discrimination between closely related mosquito species and/or populations. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Benelli, G.; Canale, A.; Vanï¿½čkovï¿½, L.","","66",2017,"","","","","","","","",""

No systematic study of the diversity or ecology of the mosquitoes of this biome is available, despite the importance of vector diseases in Brazil. The present study addressed the mosquito biodiversity in the Caatinga biome by sampling adult populations. Specimens were sampled monthly from March 2013 to September 2014 in a Caatinga conservation unit located in the Brazilian semiarid zone. Mosquito collections were carried out in Shannon traps from late afternoon to early evening, and manual aspiration was used to capture diurnal species as well. A total of 4,692 mosquitoes were collected. The most dominant and constant species were all undescribed species belonging to the genera Wyeomyia and Runchomyia, which together represented 80% of the specimens. The most abundant species of epidemiological importance was Haemagogus (Con.) leucocelaenus. The abundance of mosquitoes was positively associated with the relative humidity and temperature recorded during the month preceding the collection date. In the Caatinga, the diversity of adult mosquitoes was associated with the availability (quantity and diversity) of natural larval habitats found in the different phytophysiognomies of the biome, which vary according to temperature and humidity.

In addition, female traits that bear the hallmarks of secondary sexual characters are increasingly reported. These concurrent empirical trends have led to the repeated inference that, even under polygyny, male mate choice is a mechanism of sexual selection on female traits. It is often either assumed or argued that in these cases females are competing for males of superior “quality”; females might experience sexual selection under polygyny if they compete for mates that provide either direct or indirect benefits. However, the theoretical foundation of this testable hypothesis remains largely uninvestigated. We develop a population genetic model to probe the logic of this hypothesis and demonstrate that, contrary to common inferences, male mate choice, variation in male quality (in the form of a direct fecundity benefit to females), and female ornamentation can coexist in a population without any sexual selection on female ornamentation taking place at all. Furthermore, even in a “best case scenario” where high quality males with a preference for ornamented females are able to mate disproportionately more often with them, the evolution of female traits by sexual selection may be relatively weak. We discuss the implication of these findings for ongoing empirical and theoretical research on the evolution of sexual-signaling in females. ï¿½ 2016 The Author(s).

Given that vector-borne diseases account for almost one fifth of the total burden of infectious diseases, understanding the impacts of climate change on vector biology is fundamental to reduce current levels of transmission. This knowledge is also important to predict any potential exacerbation in vector-borne disease transmission that could emerge as the planet keeps warming, and that could also interfere with ongoing efforts to eliminate major vector-borne diseases. This chapter reviews different aspects of vector biology that are sensitive tometeorological conditions, looking at patterns that emerge under temperature gradients but also as a result of changes in the variability of weather conditions. Main topics include the interaction of vectors with pathogens, vector phenology and development, as well as the ecological dynamics of medically important insects. Reflecting the bias about insect vector knowledge, most of the examples come from studies on mosquitoes, but, where available, relevant information from other medically important insect taxa is included. Useful concepts to study impacts of climate change on insect vectors of disease are illustrated with a case study on changes in the distribution of two major globally invasive vectors: Aedes albopictus and Aedes japonicus, facing the emergence of Aedes flavopictus, formerly a rare species along an altitudinal gradient in Nagasaki, Japan. Finally, Schmalhausen's law, the principle stating that organism resilience to ""normal"" changes in the environment is decreased when forced towards the limits of any of its dimensions of existence, is presented as a tool that can be useful to understand ecological and evolutionary changes in insect vectors, and other invertebrates, following climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The selection of an oviposition site that guarantees egg and larval survival is a critical step in the reproductive process. The dangers associated with ephemeral aquatic habitats, lengthy droughts, freezing winters, and the absence of larval nutrition makes careful oviposition site selection by a female mosquito extremely important. Mosquito species exhibit a remarkable diversity of oviposition behaviors that ensure eggs are deposited into microenvironments conducive for successful larval development and the emergence of the next mosquito generation. An understanding of mosquito oviposition behavior is necessary for the development of surveillance and control opportunities directed against specific disease vectors. For example, Aedes aegypti Linnaeus is the vector of viruses causing important human diseases including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The preference of this species to oviposit in natural and artificial containers has facilitated the development of Ae. aegypti-specific surveillance and toxic oviposition traps designed to detect and control this important vector species in and around disease foci.

The dengue epidemics in Guangzhou are highly episodic and were not associated with annual rainfall over time. Our results indicate that urban environmental changes, especially variations in surface area covered by water in urban areas, can substantially alter the virus population and dengue transmission. The recent severe dengue outbreaks in Guangzhou may be due to the surge in an artificial lake construction, which could increase infection force between vector (mainly Aedes albopictus) and host when urban water area significantly increased. Impacts of urban environmental change on dengue dynamics may not have been thoroughly investigated in the past studies and more work needs to be done to better understand the consequences of urbanization processes in our changing world. © 2016 The Authors","Bi, P.; Brownstein, J.S.; Cazelles, B.; Chen, L.; Huang, S.; Jing, Q.; Kwan, M.-P.; Li, X.; Liu, Q.; Luo, L.; Pei, Y.; Sun, Z.; Tian, H.; Tong, S.; Wang, M.; Xu, B.; Yang, J.; Yang, Z.; Yuan, W.; Yue, T.; Zhou, S.","","150",2016,"","","","","","","","",""

In the past, there have been pockets of YF outbreaks in Nigeria that resulted in preventable deaths. Surveillance efforts towards avoiding another outbreak have been put in place with the aim of early detection and control. However, risk indices relating to the density of immature YF-mosquito vectors are given little consideration even though it is the first step in curbing a possible outbreak. Immature collections from 1538 houses in Ega, Oju, Otukpoicho and Otukpo in Benue State were carried out in 2010 and 2011. Risk indices such as house index (HI), container index (CI) and Breteau index (BI) were estimated. Molecular detection of YF was carried out on randomly selected Aedes larvae and pupae. Overall, 431,381 mosquitoes were collected in and around house premises. Thirteen species were identified: Ae. aegypti (Linneaus), Ae. africanus (Theobald), Ae. albopictus (Skuse), Ae. cumminsii (Theobald), Ae. luteocephalus (Newstead), Ae. simpsoni s.l. (Theobald), Ae. vittatus (Bigot), Anopheles gambiae Giles, An. nili (Theobald), Cx. nebulosus Theobald, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Lutzia tigripes (Grandpre and Charmoy) and Toxorhynchites brevipalpis Theobald. The HI, CI and BI for Ae. aegypti were high in all the study locations, but low for Ae. lueteocephalus except in Ega. With 50 immature Aedes mosquitoes screened across locations, only Ae. aegypti from Ega were positive for YF. This study places Ega on a high alert of an impending YF outbreak. Thus, urgent steps to clear this area of potential mosquito sites are highly recommended. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Agwu, E.J.; Igbinosa, I.B.; Isaac, C.","","161",2016,"","","","","","","","",""

The xenobiotics are also capable of inducing the expression of detoxification genes such as the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene in targeted insects like mosquitoes (Feyereisen, 2012). The high expression levels of CYPs in insecticide-resistant and exposed mosquitoes have been linked with a potential role in xenobiotic resistance. This study investigated the induction potential of leaf litter infusions and insecticides on the expressions of CYP4H28v2 and CYP4H31v2 in the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti using Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. Exposure of Ae. aegypti larvae to leaf litter infusions demonstrated that CYP4H28v2 and CYP4H31v2 were significantly induced by Lagerstroemia speciosa but not Ficus benjamina, Plumeria obtusa, Millettia pinnata and Pithecellobium dulce. None of the genes was significantly highly expressed in adult females exposed to d-allethrin and d-trans allethrin products. CYP4H28v2 was significantly induced in Ae. aegypti exposed to DDT, malathion and permethrin for both 5 and 10 min. DDT, malathion and permethrin significantly induced CYP4H31v2 only in Ae. aegypti exposed to the insecticides for 10 min. Exposure to the insecticides for 5 min displayed different levels of CYP4H31v2 expression with significantly higher (DDT-exposed) and lower (permethrin-exposed) levels in the mosquito. The results show that natural and synthetic xenobiotics can induce significant expression of CYP4H28v2 and CYP4H31v2 in the mosquito, indicating the potential role of the genes in mediating xenobiotic resistance. This may enhance the survival capabilities of the mosquito when in contact with phytotoxins of leaf litter in their natural ecosystem and synthetic insecticides in adulticide spray regimens. © 2016, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

To our mind, 2015 was an extraordinary year for malaria control, due to three hot news: the Nobel Prize to Youyou Tu for the discovery of artemisinin, the development of the first vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria [i.e. RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S)], and the fall of malaria infection rates worldwide, with special reference to sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are major challenges that still deserve attention, in order to boost malaria prevention and control. Indeed, parasite strains resistant to artemisinin have been detected, and RTS,S vaccine does not offer protection against Plasmodium vivax malaria, which predominates in many countries outside of Africa. Furthermore, the recent outbreaks of Zika virus infections, occurring in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, represent the most recent of four arrivals of important arboviruses in the Western Hemisphere, over the last 20 years. Zika virus follows dengue (which slyly arrived in the hemisphere over decades and became more aggressive in the 1990s), West Nile virus (emerged in 1999) and chikungunya (emerged in 2013). Notably, there are no specific treatments for these arboviruses. The emerging scenario highlights that the effective and eco-friendly control of mosquito vectors, with special reference to highly invasive species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, is crucial. The concrete potential of screening plant species as sources of metabolites for parasitological purposes is worthy of attention, as elucidated by the Y. Tu’s example. Notably, plant-borne molecules are often effective at few parts per million against Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Anopheles and Culex young instars, can be used for the rapid synthesis of mosquitocidal nanoformulations and even employed to prepare cheap repellents with low human toxicity. In addition, behaviour-based control tools relying to the employ of sound traps and the manipulation of swarming behaviour (i.e. “lure and kill” approach) are discussed. The importance of further research on the chemical cues routing mosquito swarming and mating dynamics is highlighted. Besides radiation, transgenic and symbiont-based mosquito control approaches, an effective option may be the employ of biological control agents of mosquito young instars, in the presence of ultra-low quantities of nanoformulated botanicals, which boost their predation rates. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Benelli, G.; Mehlhorn, H.","","115",2016,"","","","","","","","",""

Other flaviviruses also cause diseases in humans, although on a smaller scale. The city of São Paulo is in a highly urbanized area with few green spaces apart from its parks, which are used for recreation and where potential vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors of pathogenic Flavivirus species can be found. Although this scenario can contribute to the transmission of Flavivirus to humans, little is known about the circulation of members of this genus in these areas. In light of this, the present study sought to identify Flavivirus infection in mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) collected in parks in the city of São Paulo. Seven parks in different sectors of the city were selected. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out in each park from March 2011 to February 2012 using aspiration and traps (Shannon and CD C-CO2). Nucleic acids were extracted from the mosquitoes collected and used for reverse-transcriptase and real-time polymerase chain reactions with genus-specific primers targeting a 200-nucleotide region in the Flavivirus NS5 gene. Positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Culex and Aedes were the most frequent genera of Culicidae collected. Culex flavivirus (CxFV)-related and Aedes flavivirus (AEFV)- related nucleotide sequences were detected in 17 pools of Culex and two pools of Aedes mosquitoes, respectively, among the 818 pools of non-engorged females analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CxFV and AEFV in the city of São Paulo and Latin America, respectively. Both viruses are insect- specific flaviviruses, a group known to replicate only in mosquito cells and induce a cytopathic effect in some situations. Hence, our data suggests that CxFV and AEFV are present in Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, respectively, in parks in the city of São Paulo. Even though Flavivirus species of medical importance were not detected, surveillance is recommended in the study areas because of the presence of vertebrates and mosquitoes that could act as amplifying hosts and vectors of flaviviruses, providing the required conditions for circulation of these viruses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Araújo, A.B.; Fernandes, L.N.; Gonçalves, E.F.B.; Levi, J.E.; Malafronte, R.S.; Marrelli, M.T.; Natal, D.; Romano, C.M.; de Paula, M.B.","","157",2016,"","Araujo_2016_Detection_of_Culex_flavivirus_and_Aedes_flavivirus_nucleotide_sequences_in_mosquitoes_from_parks_in_the_city_of_Sao_Paulo_Brazil.pdf","Wrong species ","","","","","",""

These periodic expansions and retractions in both endemic regions are not completely understood, but several factors play a role including a heavy rainy season, the number of vectors, and the level of immunity coverage conferred by 17D vaccine use. The mosquito vectors are different for urban and jungle cycles for Africa and South America, and several sylvatic Aedes and Haemagogus species are its vectors, respectively. In urban settings the only vector is the peri-domestic Aedes aegypti. Nonetheless, only in Africa a third intermediate (rural) cycle is vectored by Aedes simpsoni. The diagnostic of yellow fever is made by molecular approaches (RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR), virus isolation (cell culture), serology (IgMELISA), and immunohistochemical assay on tissue of fatal cases. Treatment is only supportive, and the prevention should be focused on vaccination of people living in or moving to endemic areas. These aspects are discussed in this chapter. Although several taxonomic modifications have been proposed on Culicidae genera, mostly splitting Aedes mosquitoes into different genera, this taxonomy putting all Aedes in a single genus has been used in the yellow fever chapter.

These include mosquitoes, whose larvae are the most abundant and commonly found organisms in the leaf axils. The objective of this study was to look for immature forms of mosquitoes (the larval and pupal stages) in bromeliads in municipal parks in São Paulo and to discuss the ecological and epidemiological importance of these insects. Methods: From October 2010 to July 2013, immature mosquitoes were collected from bromeliads in 65 municipal parks in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, using suction samplers. The immature forms were maintained until adult forms emerged, and these were then identified morphologically. Results: Two thousand forty-two immature-stage specimens belonging to the genera Aedes, Culex, Trichoprosopon, Toxorhynchites, Limatus and Wyeomyia were found in bromeliads in 15 of the 65 parks visited. Aedes albopictus was the most abundant species (660 specimens collected), followed by Culex quinquefasciatus (548 specimens) and Cx. (Microculex) imitator (444). The taxa with the most widespread distribution were Ae. aegypti and Toxorhynchites spp, followed by Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Conclusion: Bromeliads in urban parks are refuges for populations of native species of Culicidae and breeding sites for exotic species that are generally of epidemiological interest. Hence, administrators and surveillance and mosquito-control agencies must constantly monitor these microenvironments as the presence of these species endangers the health of park users and employees as well as people living near the parks.","Carvalho, G.C.D.; Ceretti-Junior, W.; Christe, R.D.O.; Fernandes, A.; Junior, M.O.D.M.; Marrelli, M.T.; Medeiros-Sousa, A.R.; Mello, M.H.S.H.D.; Rizzo, M.; Strobel, R.C.","","10",2016,"","","","","","","","",""

Risk of WNV infection varies seasonally, with the greatest risk during the warmest parts of the year due in part to the accelerated extrinsic incubation rate of the virus in mosquitoes. Rates of extrinsic incubation have been shown in constanttemperature studies to increase as an approximately linear function of temperature, but for other vector-borne pathogens, such as malaria or dengue virus, nonlinear relationships have been demonstrated under cycling temperatures near the thermal limits of pathogen replication. Using typical daily air temperature profiles from three key periods of WNV amplification in a hyperendemic area of WNV activity in California's Central Valley, as well as a fourth temperature profile based on exposures that would result from daily mosquito host-seeking and resting behavior, we explored the impacts of cycling temperatures on WNV transmission by Culex tarsalis Coquillett, one of the principal vectors in the western United States. The daily cycling temperature ranges studied were representative of those that occur across much of California, but they did not significantly alter the extrinsic incubation period of WNV compared with estimates from mean temperatures alone. This suggests that within the relatively broad range we studied, WNV incubation rates are a simple function of mean temperature. Realistic daily temperature patterns that reflected mosquitoes' avoidance of daytime high temperatures during summer reduced transmission over time compared with air temperatures, indicating that adjustment for mosquito exposure temperatures would be prudent for calculating risk. ï¿½ The Authors 2016.

This finding adds a potentially noxious virus to a list of several other viruses that are widely transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus in Brazil. The pathology and epidemiology, including the distribution and vectors associated with Zika virus, are reviewed. This review is focused on viruses transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes, including dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and yellow fever virus, to emphasize the risks of occurrence for these arboviruses in Brazil and neighboring countries.

However, it is unclear how widespread it is in nature, and its importance in the epidemiology of this disease is still debated. Here, we review the literature on vertical transmission and discuss its role in dengue's epidemiology and control. We conclude that given the number of studies that failed to find evidence of vertical transmission, as well as mathematical models and its mechanistic basis, it is unlikely that vertical transmission is important for the epidemiological persistence of dengue viruses. A combination of asymptomatic infection in humans and movement of people are likely to be more important determinants of dengue's persistence. We argue, however, that there may be some need for further research into the prevalence of dengue viruses in desiccated, as well as diapausing, eggs and the role of horizontal transmission through larval cannibalism. © The Authors 2015.","Boots, M.; Grunnill, M.","","53",2016,"","","","","","","","",""

Mosquitoes were captured with Nasci aspirators and hand net in 200 census tracts, identified alive at species level and pooled in one-20 (11,090 mosquitoes, 14 species). Female pools (n = 610) were subjected to multiplex seminested-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 11 flavivirus and five alphavirus. Positive pools were tested by single RT-PCR followed by nucleotide sequencing, by RT-PCR for E1 gene [Mayaro virus (MAYV)] and by inoculation in Vero cells (MAYV) or C6/36 cells (flavivirus- es). One/171 Aedes aegypti was positive for dengue virus (DENV)-1, 12/403 Culex quinquefasciatus, and four/171 Ae. aegypti for MAYV, which was isolated from two pools containing two nonengorged females of Ae. aegypti and two of Cx. quinquefasciatus.

Although an efficient vaccine is available and has been used since the early 1940s, sylvatic YFV transmission still occurs in forested areas where anthropogenic actions are present, such as mineral extraction, rearing livestock and agriculture, and ecological tourism. In this context, two distinct techniques based on the RT-PCR derived method have been previously developed, however both methods are expensive due to the use of thermo cyclers and labeled probes. We developed isothermal genome amplification, which is a rapid, sensitive, specific and low cost molecular approach for YFV genome detection. This assay used a set of degenerate primers designed for the NS1 gene and was able to amplify, within 30. min in isothermal conditions, the YFV 17D vaccine strain derived from an African wild prototype strain (Asibi), as well as field strains from Brazil, other endemic countries from South and Central America, and the Caribbean.

However, the effects of these sexually selected traits on survival have not been studied. Elaborate leg-scale and/or abdominal ornaments are displayed by females of some Rhamphomyia dance flies (Diptera: Empididae) to flying males carrying prey gifts (females do not hunt). Previous analyses have shown significant sexual selection on these female traits. We studied viability selection on the traits by sampling the webs of two spider species and comparing prey R. longicauda females to survivors. We also investigated viability selection from one of the spiders over two seasons. We found that the direction of viability selection on R. longicauda from sticky Tetragnatha spider webs was consistent over two seasons. For abdominal ornaments the form of viability selection was positive and primarily directional (linear). Viability selection also favoured shorter tibiae but there was no significant selection on the size of residual tibial scale area. However, with the addition of dance fly kills from the non-sticky, leaf-covering webs of a Dictyna spider, abundant in only one of the seasons, the overall direction of viability selection favoured larger tibial ornaments. While noting that this viability selection on tibial scale ornaments may be a statistical artefact of the fewer traits in the two-predator analysis (abdominal structures were missing from most Dictyna prey), we suggest that simple differences in the natural history of selective agents causing mortality may partly explain the variation in whether sexual traits are under viability selection. Viability selection on ornamental traits may vary greatly between seasons with changes in the abundances of different natural enemies so that net directional selection on these traits over many generations may be weak. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","Gwynne, D.T.; Hunt, J.; Punzalan, D.","","116",2015,"","","","","","","","",""

Eukaryotic clocks consist of core transcription-translation feedback loops that generate a cycle and post-translational modifiers that maintain that cycle at about 24 h. We use the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii (subfamily Culicini, tribe Sabethini), to test whether evolutionary divergence of the circadian clock genes in this species, relative to other insects, has involved primarily genes in the core feedback loops or the post-translational modifiers. Heretofore, there is no reference transcriptome or genome sequence for any mosquito in the tribe Sabethini, which includes over 375 mainly circumtropical species. Methods: We sequenced, assembled and annotated the transcriptome of W. smithii containing nearly 95 % of conserved single-copy orthologs in animal genomes. We used the translated contigs and singletons to determine the average rates of circadian clock-gene divergence in W. smithii relative to three other mosquito genera, to Drosophila, to the butterfly, Danaus, and to the wasp, Nasonia. Results: Over 1.08 million cDNA sequence reads were obtained consisting of 432.5 million nucleotides. Their assembly produced 25,904 contigs and 54,418 singletons of which 62 % and 28 % are annotated as protein-coding genes, respectively, sharing homology with other animal proteomes. Discussion: The W. smithii transcriptome includes all nine circadian transcription-translation feedback-loop genes and all eight post-translational modifier genes we sought to identify (Fig. 1). After aligning translated W. smithii contigs and singletons from this transcriptome with other insects, we determined that there was no significant difference in the average divergence of W. smithii from the six other taxa between the core feedback-loop genes and post-translational modifiers. Conclusions: The characterized transcriptome is sufficiently complete and of sufficient quality to have uncovered all of the insect circadian clock genes we sought to identify (Fig. 1). Relative divergence does not differ between core feedback-loop genes and post-translational modifiers of those genes in a Sabethine species (W. smithii) that has experienced a continual northward dispersal into temperate regions of progressively longer summer day lengths as compared with six other insect taxa.

Insect communities of medical importance can be favored by anthropogenic alterations, increasing the risk of novel zoonotic diseases. The response of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) abundance and richness to five land-use types (shade coffee plantation, cattle field, urban forest, peri-urban forest, well-preserved montane cloud forest) and three seasons (""dry"", ""rainy"" and ""cold"") embedded in a neotropical montane cloud forest landscape was evaluated. Methods: Standardized collections were performed using 8 CDC miniature black-light traps, baited with CO2 throughout the year. Generalized additive mixed models were used to describe the seasonal and spatial trends of both species richness and abundance. Rank abundance curves and ANCOVAs were used to detect changes in the spatial and temporal structure of the mosquito assemblage. Two cluster analyses were conducted, using 1-βsim and the Morisita-Horn index to evaluate species composition shifts based on incidences and abundances. Results: A total of 2536 adult mosquitoes were collected, belonging to 9 genera and 10 species; the dominant species in the study were: Aedes quadrivittatus, Wyeomyia adelpha, Wy. arthrostigma, and Culex restuans. Highest richness was recorded in the dry season, whereas higher abundance was detected during the rainy season. The urban forest had the highest species richness (n = 7) when compared to all other sites. Species composition cluster analyses show that there is a high degree of similarity in species numbers across sites and seasons throughout the year. However, when considering the abundance of such species, the well-preserved montane cloud forest showed significantly higher abundance. Moreover, the urban forest is only 30 % similar to other sites in terms of species abundances, indicating a possible isolating role of the urban environment. Conclusion: Mosquito assemblage was differentially influenced by land-use change and seasonality, but at the same time the assemblage is rather homogeneous across the studied landscape, suggesting a high degree of spatial connectivity.

This tribe contains the genus Aedes, which is one of the three most familiar genera of mosquitoes. During the past decade, Aedini has been the focus of a series of extensive morphologybased phylogenetic studies published by Reinert, Harbach, and Kitching (RH&K). Those authors created 74 new, elevated or resurrected genera from what had been the single genus Aedes, almost tripling the number of genera in the entire family Culicidae. The proposed classification is based on subjective assessments of the ""number and nature of the characters that support the branches"" subtending particular monophyletic groups in the results of cladistic analyses of a large set of morphological characters of representative species. To gauge the stability of RH&K's generic groupings we reanalyzed their data with unweighted parsimony jackknife and maximum-parsimony analyses, with and without ordering 14 of the characters as in RH&K. We found that their phylogeny was largely weakly supported and their taxonomic rankings failed priority and other useful taxon-naming criteria. Consequently, we propose simplified aedine generic designations that 1) restore a classification system that is useful for the operational community; 2) enhance the ability of taxonomists to accurately place new species into genera; 3) maintain the progress toward a natural classification based on monophyletic groups of species; and 4) correct the current classification system that is subject to instability as new species are described and existing species more thoroughly defined. We do not challenge the phylogenetic hypotheses generated by the above-mentioned series of morphological studies. However, we reduce the ranks of the genera and subgenera of RH&K to subgenera or informal species groups, respectively, to preserve stability as new data become available.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feeding habits of culicids potentially involved in the sylvatic transmission of the virus in this region.Methods: Specimens were collected in 24 forested localities at ground level with hand nets and mouth aspirators. Collections were made quarterly between October 2006 and July 2008 during daylight hours. Blood-meal identification was carried out in mosquitoes of the tribes Aedini, Mansoniini and Sabethini. The biotin/avidin sandwich ELISA was employed to determine six source types: bird, bovine, equine, rat, human and monkey.Results: A total of 24,879 females of the three tribes were obtained, 245 (0.98%) of which were engorged. The presence of three different blood sources per engorged female was the predominant situation, and included 35.10% of the total of samples processed. Samples with two or four different sources were represented by 25.31% and 25.71%, of the specimens, respectively, while just 9.39% had only one type and 1.22%, five different sources.Aedes scapularis,Ae. serratus(Group),Psorophora albigenuandPs. feroxwere the most abundant species and accounted for about 95% of the engorged specimens.

These sources were predominant and alternated top ranking as the most frequent source according to the mosquito species and collection site. In general, primate blood was the most prevalent source.Conclusions: The human population of the region visits this ecotone frequently, which indicates the need for the periodical assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever. The frequency of non-human primate blood source in mosquito species that show minor vector importance in yellow fever virus transmission deserves attention. The eclectic feeding habits and some aspects of the interactions between potential vectors and reservoirs of yellow fever may be associated with the habitat fragmentation characteristic of the region.

Control tools rely to chemical treatments against larvae, indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets. Recently, huge efforts have been carried out to propose new eco-friendly alternatives, such as evaluation of plant-borne compounds and sterile insect technique (SIT) programs. Success of SIT is dependent to the ability of sterile males to compete for mates with wild ones. Little is still known about mating behaviour of Aedes males. Most of the studies focus on comparisons of insemination ability in sterilised and wild males, while behavioural analyses of mating behaviour are lacking. Here, I quantified the courtship and mating behaviour of A. albopictus and evaluated how daylight hours affect male mating behaviour and success. A. albopictus males chased females facing them frontally, from behind, or from a lateral side. If the female allowed genital contact, copulation followed. Otherwise, females performed rejection kicks and/or flew away. Thirty-seven percent of males obtained a successful copulation (i.e. sperm transfer occurs), lasting 63 ± 4 s. Unsuccessful copulation (20 % of males) had shorter duration (18 ± 1 s). Successful copulations followed longer male courtships (39 ± 3 s), over courtships preceding unsuccessful copulation (20 ± 2 s) or male’s rejection (22 ± 2 s). After copulation, the male rested 7 ± 0.4 s close to the female, then move off. In a semi-natural environment, male mating success was lower in early afternoon, over morning and late afternoon. However, little differences in courtship duration over daylight periods were found. This study adds knowledge to the reproductive behaviour of A. albopictus, which can be used to perform comparisons among courtship and mating ethograms from different mosquito species and strains, allowing monitoring and optimisation of mass rearing quality over time in SIT programs. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Benelli, G.","","114",2015,"","","","","","","","",""

Vector surveillance and control activities are often focused at the household level. Little is known about the importance of nonhousehold sites, including schools, in maintaining vector-borne disease transmission. The objectives of this paper were to determine the mosquito species composition in rural schools in 2 municipalities in Colombia and to assess the potential risk of vector-borne disease transmission in school settings. Entomological surveys were carried out in rural schools during the dry and rainy seasons of 2011. A total of 12 mosquito species were found: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles pseudopunctipennis, Culex coronator, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Limatus durhamii in both immature and adult forms; Ae. fluviatilis, Cx. nigripalpus, Cx. corniger, and Psorophora ferox in immature forms only; and Ae. angustivittatus, Haemagogus equinus, and Trichoprosopon lampropus in adult forms only. The most common mosquito species was Cx. quinquefasciatus. Classrooms contained the greatest abundance of adult female Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The most common Ae. aegypti breeding sites were containers classified as ""others"" (e.g., cans), followed by containers used for water storage. A high level of Ae. aegypti infestation was found during the wet season. Our results suggest that rural schools are potentially important foci for the transmission of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases. We propose that public health programs should be implemented in rural schools to prevent vector-borne diseases.

The dry condition of semiarid areas has been associated in the past with low richness of fauna and flora, not encouraging studies in this region. There is a lack of mosquito records including anophelines. Thus, to investigate the biodiversity of Anopheles mosquitoes in the Caatinga biome, we collected immature mosquitoes in aquatic habitats in a conservation reserve located in the northwestern portion of Sergipe state. The captured specimens were initially identified as Anopheles albitarsis l.s. and Anopheles argyritarsis l.s. To confirm the morphological identification, sequences were generated by cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitocondrial gene. The results showed that the specimens belong to the species Anopheles oryzalimnetes, An. argyritarsis, and Anopheles sawyeri. These are the first records of these species in this region. The presence of Anopheles in the Caatinga biome, which is characterized by arid and semiarid climatic conditions, encourages the interest in the study of biological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations, selected over time, which allow these mosquito populations to survive through the long periods of drought that is characteristic of this region. © The Authors 2015.","Dolabella, S.S.; Gama, R.A.; Marteis, L.S.; Natal, D.; Oliveira, T.M.P.; Sallum, M.A.M.; Santos, R.L.C.","","52",2015,"","","","","","","","",""

In the epidemics that occurred in Argentina between 2007-2009, several outbreaks affecting humans and howler monkeys (Alouatta spp) were reported, highlighting the importance of this disease in the context of conservation medicine and public health policies. Considering the lack of information about YF dynamics in New World NHP, our main goal was to apply modelling tools to better understand YF transmission dynamics among endangered brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans) populations in northeastern Argentina. Two complementary modelling tools were used to evaluate brown howler population dynamics in the presence of the disease: Vortex, a stochastic demographic simulation model, and Outbreak, a stochastic disease epidemiology simulation. The baseline model of YF disease epidemiology predicted a very high probability of population decline over the next 100 years. We believe the modelling approach discussed here is a reasonable description of the disease and its effects on the howler monkey population and can be useful to support evidence-based decision-making to guide actions at a regional level. © 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

It is increasingly recognized that mating can also be costly for males and they are therefore likely to exhibit choice in order to maximize their reproductive success. Stalk-eyed flies are model species in sexual selection studies. Males are sperm limited and constrained in the number of matings they are able to partake in. In addition, variation in female fecundity has been shown to correlate positively with female eyespan, so eyespan size could provide males with a reliable signal of female reproductive value. We examined male mate preference in the wild in the stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. In addition, we set up experiments in the laboratory allowing males a choice between females that varied in 1) eyespan (a proxy for fecundity) and/or 2) fecundity (manipulated through diet). We found that males exhibited preference for large eyespan females, both in the wild and laboratory studies. As well as using female eyespan as a mating cue, males were also able to assess female fecundity directly. Changes in fecundity among large eyespan females caused corresponding changes in male mate preference, whereas changes in the fecundity of small eyespan females had limited effect on their attractiveness. These results show that male mate preferences are a prevalent feature of a canonical example of female mate choice sexual selection and that males use multiple cues when they assess females as potential mates. © 2014 The Author 2014.","Cotton, A.J.; Cotton, S.; Pomiankowski, A.; Small, J.","","26",2015,"","","","","","","","",""

Many of these animals end up in long-term captive situations in zoos and rehabilitation centers, where adaptation may be difficult. Careful husbandry planning, taking into account the animals’ behavioral, anatomical, and evolutionary characteristics, can greatly improve survivability. This chapter aims to provide information on howler monkey welfare in captivity, including enclosure design, environmental enrichment, feeding and nutrition, and diseases, based upon the biology and ecology of the species. Digestive physiology, behavioral ecology, and the social system of howler monkeys are major factors to take into account to provide adequate captive conditions. Aspects such as social integration, controlled temperature, indoor and outdoor enclosures, and hiding places should be met. The provision of foraging plants within the enclosure is ideal to stimulate natural feeding behavior. Behavioral enrichment measures need to be devised to prevent behavioral disorders. For successfully maintaining howler monkeys in captivity, animals should be trained to consume a wide variety of natural fiber sources. Special attention should be placed on quantities of food sources rich in gluten and other allergenic proteins. Acute and chronic syndromes such as gastric dilatation, howler monkey wasting disease, and metabolic bone disease can be prevented when provided adequate diets. Many diseases may be acquired in the wild. However, other infectious diseases (viral, bacterial, and parasitic) are concomitant to stress and improper management. Very few studies have been carried out in captive howler populations to fully understand the husbandry and care requirements. Although howlers are very adaptive in nature and although it is a genus widely distributed throughout Central and South America, they are susceptible to many diseases that might threaten their population in the wild. Achieving a better knowledge of these factors in captivity may contribute to the development of healthy captive populations for future reintroductions to the wild. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","Pastor-Nieto, R.","","",2015,"","","","","","","","",""

However, regular outbreaks occur in endemic areas, and the spread of the virus to new, previously unaffected, areas is possible. Analysis of isolates from endemic areas reveals a strong geographic association for major genotypes, and recent epidemics have demonstrated the emergence of novel sequence variants.

In the current study, we aimed to find out how the marked differences between environmental factors of agricultural landscape patches in a steppe arid region affect the relative abundance of this species. In wetland patches, the high activity of adults was closely associated with the flood irrigation system, suggesting that the agricultural activity contributes to the proliferation of this mosquito. The steppe patches would constitute an adverse environment reflected by the abrupt decrease in abundance. Multiple linear regression showed that some explanatory variables, such as wetland patches and moment of the day (midday), did not contribute significantly to the relative abundance variation. In contrast, temperature, wind, and cloud cover seemed to regulate the biting activity of females. Temperature affected the activity of mosquitoes in the steppe but seemed to have no effect in wetland patches, where the activity of mosquitoes was permanent and more stable against changes in temperature.

Multivariate generalized linear models revealed significant differences among the traps regarding mosquito composition and abundance (deviance = 768; P = 0.016).

Furthermore, medically important mosquito species captured by the three traps showed high association with MMI. These results suggest the potential to use the MMI in studies aiming to obtain entomological surveillance information about medically important mosquitoes that occur in tropical rainforest areas. The MMI could also be used in faunal studies focusing on increasing knowledge about mosquito diversity.

A total of 66,097 mosquitoes (50 mosquito species from 12 genera) were collected from May 2001 through March 2002 at a forested site near Iquitos, Peru. Mosquitoes were collected using Aotus nancymae Hershkovitz monkey-baited CDC light traps set for 12-h day and night periods at varying heights (e.g., ground and canopy) in the forest. Of the 12 genera, three accounted for 75% of all mosquitoes collected: Culex (33%), Aedes (23%), and Psorophora (18%). The most prevalent species collected were Aedes serratus (Theobald), Culex pedroi Sirivanakarn & Belkin, Psorophora albigenu (Peryassu), and a combination of Mansonia indubitans Dyar & Shannon and Mansonia titillans (Walker), which accounted for 56% of all mosquitoes captured. In general, mosquitoes were collected more often at night and on the ground. Exceptions include Coquillettidia venezuelensis (Theobald), which were collected in relatively even numbers at both day and night and most Mansonia and some species of Anopheles, which were collected more often in the canopy.

Tribes Bromacanthini, Paronellini, and Troglopedetini are characterized by having rounded scales and reduced or no macrochaetae, and although Bromacanthini harbors two well-differentiated genera, the core genera in tribes Paronellini and Troglopedetini form a homogeneous group where even generic diagnoses were, until recently, unclear. The genera assigned to Troglopedetini (Troglopedetes Absolon, Trogolaphysa Mills, and Cyphoderopsis Carpenter) harbor many species with reduced eyes number, whereas the tribe Paronellini (genera Paronella Schött, Dicranocentruga Wray and Campylothorax Schött) includes species with 6-8 eyes. Recent analyses of the chaetotaxy of Trogolaphysa and Cyphoderopsis suggest that these genera represent specialized forms related to species in Paronellini. The taxonomy of Troglopedetes, the type genus of Troglopedetini, is based almost exclusively on claw and mucro shape and dorsal macrochaetae pattern, and few details of the complete dorsal chaetotaxy of the species are known. This contribution presents a comparative analysis of the complete dorsal chaetotaxy of two species of Troglopedetes from Spain (one new to science), two new species of Trogolaphysa from the Dominican Republic and Martinique, and Campylothorax sabanus with the purpose of identifying aspects of the chaetotaxy that could provide diagnostic characters for the separation of Trogolaphysa and Troglopedetes, and a new diagnosis for tribe Troglopedetini. The analysis shows that neither the number of chaetae nor its organization or pattern of macrochaeta provides diagnostic differences between Trogolaphysa and Troglopedetes. It is also concluded that the separation of Paronellini and Troglopedetini is not justified.

This is especially true in evolutionary theory where condition is now equated with reproductive value, genetic quality, or defined as the 'total pool of resources available for reproduction.' Condition with the latter meaning is essentially impossible to measure empirically because it is associated with multiple attributes, such as nutritional state, health, experience, foraging success, ability to cope with environmental pressures, and social status, that collectively affect individual fitness. The addition of qualifying terms that often precede condition (e.g., phenotypic, energetic, and nutritional) and the usage of terms that describe an individual's state (e.g., physiological state, energetic state, and nutritional state) add confusion to the issue. It is therefore important to evaluate the meaning of condition, the limits of its usefulness, and how it can be best measured. We suggest using a more narrow definition of condition, amenable to empirical study, would benefit evolutionary and behavioral studies. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Byers, J.A.; Clancey, E.","","120",2014,"","","","","","","","",""

Theoretical models predict that sexual selection should lead to reduction as often as exaggeration, and yet we mainly associate secondary sexual ornaments with exaggerated features such as the peacock's tail. We review the literature on mate choice experiments for evidence of reduced sexual traits. This shows that reduced ornamentation is effectively impossible in certain types of ornamental traits (behavioral, pheromonal, or color-based traits, and morphological ornaments for which the natural selection optimum is no trait), but that there are many examples of morphological traits that would permit reduction. Yet small sexual traits are very rarely seen. We analyze a simple mathematical model of Fisher's runaway process (the null model for sexual selection). Our analysis shows that the imbalance cannot be wholly explained by larger ornaments being less costly than smaller ornaments, nor by preferences for larger ornaments being less costly than preferences for smaller ornaments. Instead, we suggest that asymmetry in signaling efficacy limits runaway to trait exaggeration. © 2013 The Authors.","Iwasa, Y.; Pomiankowski, A.; Tazzyman, S.J.","","68",2014,"","","","","","","","",""

SBV spread across the continent until 2012. This paper presents SBV detection in female Culicoides spp. caught in UV traps located in 23 different locations in Poland. The midges were divided into pools containing 20.5 individual insects on average according to species and parity status. The study was based on duplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of the SBV S segment and culicoid 18S gene fragments. Forty-four out of 402 midge pools tested (10.9%) were found to be positive for the presence of viral RNA. The SBV positive Culicoides came from 10 traps spread randomly across the country and were collected between August and October 2012. The timing of the SBV positive midge collections and the locations of the traps corresponded to the epizootic situation of SBV in ruminants. SBV RNA was most frequently identified in gravid midges (36.4%), while in nulliparous, blood-fed and parous midges the percentages were 10.8% 13.0% and 8.1%, respectively. The majority (82%) of SBV positive pools belonged to Culicoides obsoletus/. scoticus complex; however, viral RNA was also found in 8 out of the 149 (5.4%) Culicoides punctatus pools tested. While no statistical differences in the Ct values between different parity groups were found, the bimodal distribution observed at the Ct frequency plots suggested active SBV replication, especially in parous and gravid midge females, and sub-transmissible infection in nulliparous and blood-fed insects. The most important findings included identification of C. punctatus as a new possible vector of SBV and the recovery of viral RNA from the nulliparous females which may suggest transovarial transmission in C. obsoletus/. scoticus complex and C. punctatus. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Grochowska, M.; Larska, M.; Lechowski, L.; Zmudziński, J.F.","","166",2013,"","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This is a descriptive study of a sylvatic yellow fever outbreak in the Southwestern region of the state from February to April 2009. Suspected and confirmed cases in humans and in non-human primates were evaluated. Entomological investigation in sylvatic environment involved capture at ground level and in the tree canopy to identify species and detect natural infections. Control measures were performed in urban areas to control Aedes aegypti. Vaccination was directed at residents living in areas with confirmed viral circulation and also at nearby cities according to national recommendation. RESULTS: Twenty-eight human cases were confirmed (39.3% case fatality rate) in rural areas of Sarutaiá, Piraju, Tejupá, Avaré and Buri. The deaths of 56 nonhuman primates were also reported, 91.4% were Allouatta sp. Epizootics was confirmed in two non-human primates in the cities of Itapetininga and Buri. A total of 1,782 mosquitoes were collected, including Haemagogus leucocelaenus, Hg. janthinomys/capricornii, and Sabethes chloropterus, Sa. purpureus and Sa. undosus. Yellow fever virus was isolated from a group of Hg. Leucocelaenus from Buri. Vaccination was carried out in 49 cities, with a total of 1,018,705 doses. Nine serious post-vaccination adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The cases occurred between February and April 2009 in areas with no recorded yellow fever virus circulation in over 60 years. The outbreak region occurred outside the original recommended vaccination area with a high percentage of susceptible population.

First, the sylvatic cycle of YFV originated in Africa and was introduced into the New World, probably as a result of the slave trade, but is absent in Asia; in contrast, sylvatic DENV likely originated in Asia and has spread to Africa but not to the New World. Second, while sylvatic YFV can emerge into extensive urban outbreaks in humans, these invariably die out, whereas four different types of DENV have established human transmission cycles that are ecologically and evolutionarily distinct from their sylvatic ancestors. Finally, transmission of YFV among humans has been documented only in Africa and the Americas, whereas DENV is transmitted among humans across most of the range of competent Aedes vectors, which in the last decade has included every continent save Antarctica. This review summarizes current understanding of sylvatic transmission cycles of YFV and DENV, considers possible explanations for their disjunct distributions, and speculates on the potential consequences of future establishment of a sylvatic cycle of DENV in the Americas. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Hanley, K.A.; Monath, T.P.; Richman, R.L.; Rossi, S.L.; Vasilakis, N.; Weaver, S.C.","","19",2013,"","","","","","","","",""

Objective: To update the distribution of the species of the Haemagogus genus in urban and periurban areas in the departments of Atlántico and Sucre in the Caribbean region of Colombia. Materials and methods: The entomological material was collected in the departments of Atlántico and Sucre by means of larval traps during 2010 to 2011. Eighty per cent of the immature forms were preserved in 70% alcohol. Some were kept alive for the sake of obtaining entomological series. Taxonomical determination was done with Arnell's keys and description, 1973. Results: In Atlántico, 2.32% of 37.573 immature Culicidae (871) were larvae of the Haemagogus genus. In Sucre, 44 larvae of the same genus were collected (1.22% of 3.611). The species collected in both regions were Hg. equinus, Hg. anastasionis, and Hg. celeste. The Haemagogus genus was most abundant during the months of heaviest rainfall, from June to November. Conclusion: The presence of Hg. anastasionis, Hg. celeste and Hg. equinus was detected in artificial containers, in urban and periurban areas of Atlántico and Sucre.

Several species of this family are vectors of pathogens causing multiple diseases which to generate high rates of morbidity and mortality and numerous economic losses. Studies of the geographical distribution of Culicidae and its historical biogeography analysis will allow us to obtain more knowledge about the natural history and explanations of geological and ecological reasons of the distribution and also the epidemiological patterns of diseases which are involved. The delimitation of areas of endemism (AE) is a crucial initial step for the analysis of historical biogeography and for this we developed a database of 9,610 records in 435 localities, 20 genera and 261 species from Venezuela, map distribution, and explicit analyzes of areas of endemism (AE) and parsimonious of endemicity (PAE) software NDM / VNDM. The records compiled of Culicidae are mainly distributed in the north of the country, with particular distributions to mountainous or Guayana Shield region, among others. The results suggest the proposal of three endemism areas for mosquitoes: Guayana Shield-Pantepui, North-Central Region and Andean mountains cordillera, which are concordant with recent and ancestral areas of the geological history of the country.","Del Ventura, F.; Liria, J.; Navarro, J.-C.","","53",2013,"","Del_Ventura_2013_Determination_of_areas_of_endemism_in_mosquitoes_Diptera-_Culicidae_in_Venezuela_through_explicit_optimization_criteria.pdf","No location data ","","","","","",""

The study was conducted near the Simplício Hydroelectic Reservoir (SHR) located on the border of the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Samples were collected using oviposition traps installed in forest vegetation cover between 1.70 and 4.30 m above ground level during the months of April, June, August, October, and December of 2011. Haemagogus janthinomys (Dyar), Haemagogus leucocelaenus (Dyar and Shannon), Aedes albopictus (Skuse), and Aedes terrens (Walker) specimens were present among the collected samples, the first two of which being proven vectors of sylvatic yellow fever (SYF) in Brazil and the latter is a vector of dengue in mainland Asia. As the data set was zero-inflated, a specific Poisson-based model was used for the statistical analysis. When all four species were considered in the model, only heights used for egg laying and months of sampling were explaining the distribution. However, grouping the species under the genera Haemagogus Williston and Aedes Meigen showed a significant preference for higher traps of the former. Considering the local working population of SHR is very large, fluctuating, and potentially exposed to SYF, and that this virus occurs in almost all Brazilian states, monitoring of Culicidae in Brazil is essential for assessing the risk of transmission of this arbovirus. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.","Alencar, J.; Dégallier, N.; Guimarães, A.É.; Lucio, P.S.; Mello, C.F.D.; Morone, F.; Serra-Freire, N.M.D.","","50",2013,"","Alencar_2013_Flight_height_preference_for_oviposition_of_mosquito_diptera_Culicidae_vectors_of_sylvatic_yellow_fever_virus_near_the_hydroelectric_reservoir_of_simplicio_minas_Gerais_Brazil.pdf","","22° 5' 37'' S , 43° 5' 3'' W","22° 5' 37'' S , 43° 5' 3'' W","N/A","d; /; m; /; s","n; o","y; e; s"

Eggs of Sabethes cyaneus (length: 349.6 ± 2.7 m; width: 172.6 ± 1.14 m; n 10) are almost biconical when examined from the top. From a lateral perspective 2 surfaces can be seen. One surface is smooth and more convex, whereas the other is less convex and partially covered by a network from which many fungiform tubercles arise. The micropyle is situated on the smooth surface of the pointed anterior tip and is surrounded by an irregular row of tubercles, some of which are leaf shaped. No structures possibly involved in adhesion to surfaces are visible. When hatching, the egg splits dorsoventrally approximately two-thirds of the length from the anterior end. The tubercles appear to be water repellent, and the more convex/smoother surface is downturned, and this position on water was confirmed by direct observation.

Both are regulated via alternative splicing by an upstream female-specific TRA/TRA-2 complex, recognizing a common cis element. dsx controls somatic sexual differentiation of non-neural as well as of neural tissues. fru, on the other hand, expresses male-specific functions only in neural system where it is required to built the neural circuits underlying proper courtship behaviour. In the mosquito Aedes aegypti sex determination is different from Drosophila. The key male determiner M, which is located on one of a pair of homomorphic sex chromosomes, controls sex-specific splicing of the mosquito dsx orthologue. In this study we report the genomic organization and expression of the fru homologue in Ae. aegypti (Aeafru). We found that it is sex-specifically spliced suggesting that it is also under the control of the sex determination pathway. Comparative analyses between the Aeafru and Anopheles gambiae fru (Angfru) genomic loci revealed partial conservation of exon organization and extensive divergence of intron lengths. We find that Aeadsx and Aeafru share novel cis splicing regulatory elements conserved in the alternatively spliced regions. We propose that in Aedes aegypti sex-specific splicing of dsx and fru is most likely under the control of splicing regulatory factors which are different from TRA and TRA-2 found in other dipteran insects and discuss the potential use of fru and dsx for developing new genetic strategies in vector control. © 2013 Salvemini et al.","Aceto, S.; Alphey, L.; D'Amato, R.; Neira, M.; Nimmo, D.; Petrella, V.; Polito, L.C.; Saccone, G.; Salvemini, M.","","8",2013,"","","","","","","","",""

Despite the medical importance of this tick, no in-depth studies have been carried out to distinguish different forms and their capability in transmitting the disease. To this end, this study was carried out to identify phenotypic diversity, and contamination of the different strains of this tick to Borrelia persica in Zanjan province. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, microscopic examination was carried out with 0.1 micrometer precision, and 20 quantitative morphometric indexes were measured alongside the assessment of qualitative factors. The contamination to Borrelia was investigated through feeding on three-day-old neonate mice, and injection of squashed suspension into the peritoneum of the mice. Results: laboratory investigation revealed that the contamination by Borrelia in tick samples was 0.004-0.008. Morphologic traits examination revealed that body size of the ticks from Khodabandeh and Mahneshan cities was 6.81× 3.93 mm. The two strains of Khodabandeh and Mahneshan had different capitulum widths, and genital opening sizes. Males of Ornithodoros tholozani were smaller than females reaching a size of 4.6 × 2.6 mm. Apart from the length and width of capitulum which were higher in Mahneshan samples than in Khodabandeh, the other indexes were not significantly different. The nymphs in the two strains differed in the body size, the length and width of capitulum, the lengths of the second and fourth segments of the palp; however, they were identical in other indexes. Conclusion: Regarding the morphologic distinction between samples in the study sites and their contamination by Borrelia; and lack of comprehensive knowledge in analyzing the data, it seems necessary to conduct extensive research in order to review description of the species, express taxonomic position of different strains and provide molecular identification protocol in order to prioritize the application sites, and monitor the administration plans to precisely determine the infection rate of the ticks to Borrelia in diverse geographical regions.","Ghavami, M.B.; Mohammadi, J.; Mohammadi, M.","","21",2013,"","","","","","","","",""

Due to gregariousness, opportunities for multiple copulations in both sexes are not supposed to be restricted. Females produce only one brood during their life and die within a few days following the birth of their nymphs, but this unique brood could be the result of either single or multiple mating events (i.e., monandry vs. polyandry). In this study, we first determined the age of sexual receptivity of both males and females. Larval development in this species is shorter in males than in females and thus, this species is protandric. Males were not able to copulate the day after emergence. Contrary to males, teneral females (i.e., females achieving their imaginal molt but not yet fully sclerotised and colored)were attractive andwere able to mate with males. In the second experiment, we tested the existence of multiple matings in both sexes. Our results showed that females were monandrous whereas males were polygynous. Since we had observed that females were monoandrous, we expected them to be choosy and we determined their ability to discriminate between virgin and nonvirgin males. When given the choice, females preferred virgin males and overall, they were more successful at mating than experienced ones. Our results suggest that monandry may be primarily driven by the female's short life-span fecundity. The occurrence of teneral mating in this species calls into question the existence of a male strategy for monopolizing females, and as well as the implication of female choice.

These diseases emerge as a consequence of changes made to the terrain that often increase the natural and artificial mosquito larval habitats. Many of these insects are of public health importance and population increases result in an increased risk of disease transmission. Objective: The culicine (mosquito) and phlebotomine (sand fly) populations were characterized in the area of the Porce II and Porce III hydroelectric projects of Antioquia between 1990 to 2009. Materials and methods: Periodical entomological samplings were made in the area of impact, in the workers camps, and construction sites. Adult specimens were captured with nets, Shannon light traps, CDC light traps, and protected human bait. Results: Mosquito larvae of the following species were identified: Culex coronator, Culex nigripalpus, Culex corniger, Culex quinquefasciatus and Limatus durhami. The most frequently identifiers of larval habitats were low tanks, waste cans, tires, and aquatic plants. Aedes aegypti specimens were captured in only two rural locations from two municipalities within the area of influence. Specimens from the following mosquito genera were captured in forest areas: Aedes, Mansonia, Culex, Psorophora, Wyeomyia, Phonyomyia, Uranotaenia, Haemagogus and Sabethes. The most important mosquito found was Haemogogus janthinomis, an efficient yellow fever vector in Colombia. The area has been endemic for leishmaniasis and in the current study, 20 species of Lutzomyia sand flies, potential vectors, were identified.

Theoretically, female sexual traits may be influenced by selection acting on the females via male mate choice, while the evolutionary consequences of male mate preferences are largely unknown, especially in the context of sexual conflict. We tested whether male mate choice affects the evolution of female colour in the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis in which females exhibit dimorphism consisting of a gynomorph that experiences ontogenetic colour change and an andromorph that does not. We first quantitatively confirmed that only gynomorphs change their body colour in relation to sexual maturation. In field experiments, males were unwilling to mate with sexually immature gynomorphs, although they attempted to mate with immature andromorphs. This is because males changed their mating preference for female colour depending on previous copulation experiences with sexually mature females. As a result, immature andromorphs received more male harassment than sexually immature gynomorphs, and then showed decreased food intake. Immature-specific colour functioned to avoid costly male harassment during female prereproductive stages, suggesting that ontogenetic colour changes in females have evolved as an antiharassment strategy of females via male mate choice. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Morimoto, G.; Takahashi, Y.; Watanabe, M.","","84",2012,"","","","","","","","",""

This richness is distributed in the country in six continental Biomes: Amazon, Caatinga, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Pantanal and Pampa, which are characterized by the uniformity of the environment, according to climate, vegetation type, soil and altitude. In one of the major insect orders, Diptera, the taxonomic and ecological knowledge is focused on species of economic or medical importance, for example, in Culicidae. There are approximately 470 species of Culicidae distributed in Brazil, with species considered wild and others anthropogenic, with greater adaptability to human-modified systems. One factor that determines the occurrence of these species is the structural heterogeneity of the Biome, being that the greatest diversification of resources in the habitat allows the coexistence. However, the trend of the habitats becoming smaller and more isolated has been causing biodiversity loss, that in Brazil, the most conservative estimates indicate that 30% of the natural territory is changed by human use. The Culicidae adaptability to the anthropic environment is the reason why this family has a great evolutionary success, allowing these insects to live in the middle of anthropized environments. It is possible that the diseases spreadby these insects will make continuous adjustments, so it is important to highlight the distribution of Culicidae in Brazil and relate it to changes in natural environments and to epidemiology of some diseases. We should, then, assume epidemiological and entomological surveillance policies, also relating wild Culicidae, in favor of a lucid picture of the Culicidae fauna, as a whole, in local and global scale.","Guedes, M.L.P.","","16",2012,"","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has provided strong support for the hypothesis that elaborate female traits can be maintained by sexual or social selection; however, most research on female ornamentation has focused on pigment-based colours, and less is known about how structural colours are maintained. Both sexes of the turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota superciliosa) have a blue-green racket-tipped tail, and it remains unknown if tail coloration serves as a sexual or social signal in one or both sexes. Here, we describe sexual dichromatism in the blue-green portion of the tail racket, and we test for a relationship between coloration and condition, as indicated by growth bars. Tail colour of both sexes has a similar spectral shape, and there is significant, although moderate, sexual dichromatism: males are brighter than females, and males have marginally greater blue-green saturation than females. The length of feather grown per day is positively related to overall feather brightness, but this relationship is only present in males. The relationship between male coloration and condition suggests that tail colour has the potential to convey information about individual quality during mate choice or contest competition. The lack of a similar relationship in females suggests that female tail colour does not convey the same condition-dependent information that we suggest may be reflected by male colour. Female tail colour may therefore reflect other aspects of condition, be involved in other (non-condition-dependent) forms of communication, or be expressed as a non-functional byproduct of genetic correlation between the sexes. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.","Murphy, T.G.; Pham, T.T.","","106",2012,"","","","","","","","",""

Empirical tests of the PMSS have been largely equivocal, however, which may be because most have not considered the role of early life-history effects. 2.Many sexually selected traits are carotenoid-based. Allocation of dietary-derived carotenoids to sexual ornaments may trade-off with allocation to pro-inflammatory immune response and/or antioxidant functions, mediated by the oxidative status of individuals. Exposure to parasites can increase oxidative stress, so under this scenario, sexually selected traits indicate ability to resist oxidative stress rather than ability to resist parasites per se. Such life-history trade-offs, mediated by oxidative status of individuals, are particularly acute during growth and development. 3.Here, we use ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, a strongly sexually selected species, to test whether supplementation with dietary antioxidants (vitamin E) can mitigate the effects of early exposure to parasites (the nematode, Heterakis gallinarum), via alteration of the oxidative status of individuals, and positively affect the expression of sexual ornaments at adulthood. 4.We found that vitamin E mediated the effect of early exposure to parasites on levels of oxidative damage at 8weeks of age and reduced the parasite load of individuals at adulthood as predicted. However, the expression of sexual ornaments, immune function and growth were unaffected by either early vitamin E supplementation or manipulation of parasite load. In contrast to the predictions of the PMSS hypothesis, the intensity of sexual ornament expression was not related to either parasite load or oxidative status of individuals (current or long-term). Consequently, there was no evidence that the expression of sexual ornaments provided information on the ability of males to resist infection from parasites. © 2012 The Authors.

Outbreaks have been localized and sporadic in the Pan-Amazonia forest since its first isolation in 1954 (Trinidad and Tobago). The literature available is scarce, diverse and dispersed. Mayaro virus is an alphavirus, phylogenetically related to the Semliki forest antigenic complex. UNA and Mayaro viruses are the only viruses of this complex that have been isolated in the New World. Mayaro consists of single-stranded RNA of positive charge, length of 12 kb, subdivided into genomic and subgenomic regions, which encode nonstructural and structuralproteins respectively. Mayaro shows a great plasticity in vertebrate host infection, whereas high specificity in the family Culicidae (mosquitoes). Risk factors of infection are associated with forest areas of northern South America and therainy season. Two genotypes of MAYV have been identified, L (Belterra, Brazil) and D (widely distributed in the Pan-Amazonia). The enzootic cycle is similar to the jungle cycle of yellow fever, which involves Haemagogus mosquitoes and monkeys as reservoirs. However, the involvement of other secondary vectors and other hosts may be important in spread of the virus. Humans may have high levels of viremia, and efficient experimental transmission has been demonstrated in Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Aedes scapularis, suggesting a significant risk to public health in urban, rural and peridomestic locations close to enzootic foci of Mayaro virus.","Muñoz, M.; Navarro, J.C.","","32",2012,"","","","","","","","",""

Some Neotropical monkeys (howler monkeys, genus Alouatta) develop fatal YF virus (YFV) infections similar to those reported in humans, even with minimum exposure to the infection. Epizootics in wild primates may be indicating YFV circulation, and the surveillance of such outbreaks in wildlife is an important tool to help prevent human infection. In 2001, surveillance activities successfully identified YF-related death in a black-and-gold howler monkey (Alouatta caraya), Rio Grande do Sul State (RGS) in southern Brazil, and the YFV was isolated from a species of forest-dwelling mosquito (Haemagogus leucocelaenus). These findings led the State Secretariat of Health to initiate a monitoring program for YF and other 18 arboviral infections in Alouatta monkeys. The monitoring program included monkey captures, reporting of monkey casualties by municipalities, and subsequent investigations. If monkey carcasses were found in forests, samples were collected in a standardized manner and this practice resulted in increased reporting of outbreaks. In October 2008, a single howler monkey in a northwestern RGS municipality was confirmed to have died from YF. From October 2008 to June 2009, 2,013 monkey deaths were reported (830 A. caraya and 1,183 A. guariba clamitans). Viruses isolation in blood, viscera, and/or immunohistochemistry led to the detection of YF in 204 of 297 (69%) (154 A. g. clamitans and 50 A. caraya) dead Alouatta monkeys tested. The number of municipalities with confirmed YFV circulation in howlers increased from 2 to 67 and 21 confirmed human cases occurred.

Better understanding of drivers of seasonality could provide insights into the relationship between the physical environment and infection risk, which is particularly important in the context of global ecological change in general, and climate change in particular. In broad terms, seasonality represents oscillation in pathogens' effective reproductive number, which, in turn, must reflect oscillatory changes in infectiousness, contact patterns, pathogen survival, or host susceptibility. Epidemiological challenges to correct identification of seasonal drivers of risk include failure to adjust for predictable correlation between disease incidence and seasonal exposures, and unmeasured confounding. The existing evidence suggests that the seasonality of some enteric and respiratory viral pathogens may be driven by enhanced wintertime survival of pathogens, and also by increased host susceptibility resulting from relative 'wintertime immune suppression'. For vector-borne diseases and zoonoses, environmental influences on vector or reservoir abundance, and vector biting rates, are probably more important. However, numerous areas of uncertainty exist, making this an exciting area for future research. © 2012 The Author.

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that selection tends to operate in different ways in males and females, with female traits more often mediating competition for ecological resources, rather than mate acquisition. Two main solutions have been proposed to accommodate this disparity. One is to expand the concept of sexual selection to include all mechanisms related to fecundity; another is to adopt an alternative conceptual framework-the theory of social selection- in which sexual selection is one component of a more general form of selection resulting from all social interactions. In this study, we summarize the history of the debate about female ornaments and weapons, and discuss potential resolutions. We review the components of fitness driving ornamentation in a wide range of systems, and show that selection often falls outside the limits of traditional sexual selection theory, particularly in females. We conclude that the evolution of these traits in both sexes is best understood within the unifying framework of social selection. © 2012 The Royal Society.","Lyon, B.E.; Montgomerie, R.; Tobias, J.A.","","367",2012,"","","","","","","","",""

The matching of harmonic components of flight tone in male-female pairs of flying mosquitoes, or harmonic convergence, was recently described. This behaviour occurs prior to mating and has been suggested to function in mate selection. We investigated the hypothesis that harmonic convergence is a component of mosquito courtship. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that harmonic convergence should provide information to potential mates about fitness benefits. We measured the effect of harmonic convergence behaviour on the direct and indirect benefits obtained by females. We found that the sons of pairs that converged at harmonic frequencies prior to mating had increased mating success and that these offspring were themselves more likely to converge prior to mating. These results suggest that males may be able to signal information about their genetic quality to females prior to mating and that this signal may be heritable. These findings are important for our understanding of mosquito behaviour and have applications in the control of mosquito-borne disease.

Yet, experimental studies of mutual mate choice are rare as is information on the types of female traits that are favored by male mate choice. We first assessed the cost of mating to males under different feeding regimes in 2 honey locust beetles (Bruchidae, Megabruchidius spp.) where females actively search for and court males. Further, in a series of mate choice trials, we manipulated female mating status and male food provisioning to assess how male and female characteristics affected the outcome of male-female interactions. Mating carried substantial costs to males, but these costs were independent of food availability. Males generally showed a preference for large females but also for females that delivered a more vigorous courtship display. Moreover, males preferred virgin females in one species but nonvirgin females in the other species, and we provide data suggesting that this choice is adaptive. Female choice was restricted to a lower rate of female mate rejection of larger males in one of the species. Our results reveal a striking interspecific variation in mutual mate choice, even between these closely related species, and show that sexual selection in females can act on much the same types of traits that are commonly considered sexually selected in males, such as size-related traits and courtship vigor. This suggests that a preference for condition-dependent traits may be a commonality that is shared between mate choice by both sexes. © 2011 The Author.","Arnqvist, G.; Fritzsche, K.; Salehialavi, Y.","","22",2011,"","","","","","","","",""

A total of 19,604 female mosquitoes from 20 identifiable species were trapped: 7,549 at Sedlec and 12,055 at Kančí obora. The activity of the major species of mosquitoes in South Moravia differed throughout the course of the day. Calamity species of the genus Aedes and Ochlerotatus remained active throughout the day and night, but with different course. Aedes vexans, Ae. cinereus, and Ae. rossicus were most active in the late afternoon and highly active for most of the night. Ochlerotatus sticticus was captured most often in the afternoon, and its abundance decreased rapidly before sunset. The activity of Oc. cantans s.l. (Oc. cantans + Oc. annulipes) females varied little during the day and night. The daily activity for the main vectors of West Nile virus, Culex pipiens and Cx. modestus, were totally different from that of other species. Cx. pipiens females showed significant night activity, while Cx. modestus was most active in the evening. Nighttime activity was also observed in female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. © 2011 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.","Gelbič, I.; Peško, J.; Šebesta, O.","","6",2011,"","","","","","","","",""

Here, we show that diurnal temperature range (DTR) affects two important parameters underlying dengue virus (DENV) transmission by Aedes aegypti. In two independent experiments using different DENV serotypes, mosquitoes were less susceptible to virus infection and died faster under larger DTR around the same mean temperature. Large DTR (20 °C) decreased the probability of midgut infection, but not duration of the virus extrinsic incubation period (EIP), compared with moderate DTR (10 °C) or constant temperature. A thermodynamic model predicted that at mean temperatures <18 °C, DENV transmission increases as DTR increases, whereas at mean temperatures >18 °C, larger DTR reduces DENV transmission. The negative impact of DTR on Ae. aegypti survival indicates that large temperature fluctuations will reduce the probability of vector survival through EIP and expectation of infectious life. Seasonal variation in the amplitude of daily temperature fluctuations helps to explain seasonal forcing of DENV transmission at locations where average temperature does not vary seasonally and mosquito abundance is not associated with dengue incidence. Mosquitoes lived longer and were more likely to become infected under moderate temperature fluctuations, which is typical of the high DENV transmission season than under large temperature fluctuations, which is typical of the low DENV transmission season. Our findings reveal the importance of considering short-term temperature variations when studying DENV transmission dynamics.","Carrington, L.B.; Fansiri, T.; Kramer, L.D.; Lambrechts, L.; Paaijmans, K.P.; Scott, T.W.; Thomas, M.B.","","108",2011,"","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, the adaptive value of female ornaments in species with a male-biased OSR and male competition remains largely unresolved. Mutual mate choice is one proposed explanation for the evolution of ornaments expressed in both males and females, a hypothesis supported by the increasing empirical evidence of mutual mate choice in species with a male-biased OSR. None the less, the evolution of female ornaments remains constrained, as investment in ornaments may detract from any direct benefits being signalled to males and females may fail to reap benefits sufficient to outweigh the costs of signalling. We used phenotypic engineering (i.e. manipulation of ornament size) to ask whether both sexes show a preference for sexually homologous ornaments in the polygynous mosquito, Sabethes cyaneus. We found a directional male preference for ornamented females, but no female preference for ornamented males. There was no evidence of assortative mating based on ornament size. We discuss these results within the framework of current sexual selection theory, addressing implications for both the evolution of male mate choice and the evolution of female ornaments. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Arnqvist, G.; South, S.H.","","81",2011,"","","","","","","","",""

(Diptera: Culicidae), is well recognized for its extensive adaptation to diverse ecological conditions and for genetic variation. Recognizing the importance of strain variation of this mosquito, researchers have established a large number of laboratory strains. Some of the popular strains have been used for research for years in many laboratories around the world. However, the exact origins of many of these strains are unknown. In this review, publications and archival records were examined to report the early laboratory mosquito rearing practices around the world and to identify the origins of selected strains. The records showed that inter-laboratory sharing of strains was already underway in the early part of the 20th century because of the ease of breeding Ae. aegypti and of sending eggs by mail. It also was found that the four strains established in major U.S. institutions by the mid-1930s, including the ""ROCK"" (short for Rockefeller) strain, had been derived from Cuba, Nigeria, Philippines, or Puerto Rico, all known for a long history of transmission of yellow fever virus or dengue virus rather than from North America. The strains used for research in Europe were primarily derived from West Africa, but strains of Asian, Caribbean, and South American origins also were used for comparative experiments among geographic strains. Neglected issues related to strain designation and original source identification in scientific publications were found and their relevance to current research is discussed. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Kuno, G.","","47",2010,"","","","","","","","",""

The scenery has worsened in the last decade because several serotypes are circulating and producing a hyper-endemic situation, with an increase of DHF/DSS cases as well as the number of fatalities. Herein, we report dengue virus surveillance in mosquitoes using a Flavivirus genus-specific RT-Hemi-Nested-PCR assay. The mosquitoes (Culicidae, n = 1700) collected in the Northeast, Southeast and South of Brazil, between 1999 and 2005, were grouped into 154 pools. Putative genomes of DENV-1, -2 and -3 were detected in 6 mosquito pools (3.8%). One amplicon of putative DENV-1 was detected in a pool of Haemagogus leucocelaenus suggesting that this virus could be involved in a sylvatic cycle. DENV-3 was found infecting 3 pools of larvae of Aedes albopictus and the nucleotide sequence of one of these viruses was identified as DENV-3 of genotype III, phylogenetically related to other DENV-3 isolated in Brazil.

We evaluated the status of susceptibility to insecticides that are used in public health like organophosphates, organochlorates, pyrethroids and carbamates on populations of A. aegypti in the department of Atlántico. Biological assays were performed applying the standardized methodology of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with diagnostic doses of deltamethrin (6.25 μg/ml), lambda-cyhalothrin (6.25 μg/ml), malathion (100 μg/ml), fenitothrion (75 μg/ml), propoxur (12.5 μg/ml) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane DDT (150 μg/ml) on A. aegypti mosquitoes (F2) from the municipalities of Barranquilla, Soledad (Villa Katanga and Floresta), Malambo, Puerto Colombia and Baranoa. All the evaluated populations showed susceptibility to malathion and deltamethrin, five to fenitothrion, four to propoxur and two to lambda-cyhalothrin. All of them expressed loss of susceptibility to DDT. No significant differences were found in percent mortality between populations for malathion (P = 0.15), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (P = 0.54) and deltamethrin (P = 0.99), while significant differences were found for lambda-cyhalothrin (P << 0.01), propoxur (P < 0.01) and fenitothrion (P << 0.01).

Anopheles cruzii is the primary human Plasmodium vector in southern and southeastern Brazil. The distribution of this mosquito follows the coast of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Previous studies indicated that An. cruzii is a complex of cryptic species. Results. A multilocus approach using six loci, three circadian clock genes and three encoding ribosomal proteins, was implemented to investigate in more detail the genetic differentiation between the An. cruzii populations from Santa Catarina (southern Brazil) and Bahia States (northeastern Brazil) that represent two sibling species. The analysis revealed very high FSTvalues and fixed differences between the two An. cruzii sibling species in all loci, irrespective of their function. An Isolation with Migration model was fit to the data using the IM program. The results reveal no migration in either direction and allowed a rough estimate of the divergence time between the two sibling species. Conclusions. Population genetics analysis of An. cruzii samples from two Brazilian localities using a multilocus approach confirmed that they represent two different sibling species in this complex. The results suggest that the two species have not exchanged migrants since their separation and that they possibly diverged between 1.1 and 3.6 million years ago, a period of intense climatic changes. © 2010 Rona et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Carvalho-Pinto, C.J.; Mazzoni, C.J.; Peixoto, A.A.; Rona, L.D.P.","","10",2010,"","","","","","","","",""

The history of mosquito management reveals two operative spatial ontologies, one an immanent horizontalism underwriting an intimate strategy of detection and destruction of breeding sites, the other a transcendent verticalism appropriate for the partitioning of space in support of widespread chemical spraying of adult populations. We find that two institutions in contemporary, mosquito-rich Arizona-the Pima County Health Department and Maricopa County Vector Control-are representative of this split in management. In this article we attempt to account for the observed interagency differences. Doing so, we suggest, requires an assemblage theory that brings together managers, institutions, and sociocultural-environmental-technological-political contexts with the flights of the mosquito itself. © 2010 by Association of American Geographers.","Jones III, J.P.; Robbins, P.F.; Shaw, I.G.R.","","100",2010,"","","","","","","","",""

We investigate whether vertical habitat stratification and rainfall modified major ecological parameters of this mosquito ensemble, combining descriptive and hypothesis-testing statistics with species richness and diversity metrics in the analyses. A total of 31 species was recorded. Contrary to expectations, the host-seeking mosquito fauna was less diverse in the forest canopy than in the understorey. In particular, species diversity and evenness were higher in understorey samples, whereas species richness estimates were similar in both habitats. Only two out of 12 species tested for vertical stratification were clearly acrodendrophilic, and five preferred understorey habitats. The mosquito fauna was more diverse in the rainy than in the dry season. We propose the hypothesis that female mosquito density and host defensive behavior may promote host seeking in nonpreferred habitats by acrodendrophilic mosquito species.

The aim of this study was to obtain information on the bionomics of Haemagogus and other mosquitoes inside tree holes in that area. Eighteen open tree holes were sampled for immature specimens. Adults were collected twice a month in the forest in Santa Albertina county from July 2000 to June 2001. The seasonal frequency of fourth instars was obtained by the Williams geometric mean (Mw), while the adult frequency was estimated either by hourly arithmetic or the Williams' means. Cole's index was applied to evaluate larval inter-specific associations. Among the ten mosquito species identified, the most abundant was Aedes terrens Walker followed by Sabethes tridentatus Cerqueira and Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar. Larval and adult abundance of these species was higher in summer than in winter.

However, it is unclear whether these result from in situ evolution (enzootic maintenance) or regular reintroduction of YFV from the South American mainland. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we carried out a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of over 100 prM/E gene sequences sampled from 8 South American countries. These included newly sequenced isolates from the recent 2008-2009 Trinidad epizootic and isolates derived from mainland countries within the last decade. The results indicate that the most recent common ancestor of the 2008-2009 epizootic existed in Trinidad 4.2 years prior to 2009 (95% highest probability density [HPD], 0.5 to 9.0 years). Our data also suggest a Trinidad origin for the progenitor of the 1995 Trinidad epizootic and support in situ evolution of YFV between the 1979 and 1988-1989 Trinidad epizootics. Using the same phylogeographic approach, we also inferred the historical spread of YFV in the Americas. The results suggest a Brazilian origin for YFV in the Americas and an overall dispersal rate of 182 km/year (95% HPD, 52 to 462 km/year), with Brazil as the major source population for surrounding countries. There is also strong statistical support for epidemiological links between four Brazilian regions and other countries. In contrast, while there were well-supported epidemiological links within Peru, the only statistically supported external link was a relatively weak link with neighboring Bolivia.

Similarly, there is limited information on the molecular epidemiology of yellow fever virus (YFV) in Africa even though it most likely first emerged on this continent. Through an analysis of complete E gene sequences, including a newly acquired viral collection from Central and West Africa (Senegal, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and Mauritania), we show that YFV exhibits markedly lower rates of evolutionary change than dengue virus, despite numerous biological similarities between these two viruses. From this observation, along with a lack of clock-like evolutionary behavior in YFV, we suggest that vertical transmission, itself characterized by lower replication rates, may play an important role in the evolution of YFV in its enzootic setting. Despite a reduced rate of nucleotide substitution, phylogenetic patterns and estimates of times to common ancestry in YFV still accord well with the dual histories of colonialism and the slave trade, with areas of sylvatic transmission (such as Kedougou, Senegal) acting as enzootic/epidemic foci.

Analyses of the data set with all multistate characters treated as unordered under implied weights, implemented by TNT version 1.1, with values of the concavity constant K ranging from 7 to 12 each produced a single most parsimonious cladogram (MPC). The MPCs obtained with K values of 7-9 were identical, and that for K = 10 differed only in small changes in the relationships within one subclade. Because values of K < 7 and > 10 produced large changes in the relationships among the taxa, the stability of relationships exemplified by the MPC obtained from the K = 9 analysis is used to interpret the phylogeny and classification of Aedini. Clade support was assessed using parsimony jackknife and symmetric resampling. Overall, the results reinforce the patterns of relationships obtained previously despite differences in the taxa and characters included in the analyses. With two exceptions, all of the groups represented by two or more species were once again recovered as monophyletic taxa. Thus, the monophyly of the following genera and subgenera is corroborated: Aedes, Albuginosus, Armigeres (and its two subgenera), Ayurakitia, Bothaella, Bruceharrisonius, Christophersiomyia, Collessius (and its two subgenera), Dahliana, Danielsia, Dobrotworskyius, Downsiomyia, Edwardsaedes, Finlaya, Georgecraigius (and its two subgenera), Eretmapodites, Geoskusea, Gilesius, Haemagogus (and its two subgenera), Heizmannia (and subgenus Heizmannia), Hopkinsius (and its two subgenera), Howardina, Hulecoeteomyia, Jarnellius, Kenknightia, Lorrainea, Macleaya, Mucidus (and its two subgenera), Neomelaniconion, Ochlerotatus (subgenera Chrysoconops, Culicelsa, Gilesia, Pholeomyia, Protoculex, Rusticoidus and Pseudoskusea), Opifex, Paraedes, Patmarksia, Phagomyia, Pseudarmigeres, Rhinoskusea, Psorophora (and its three subgenera), Rampamyia, Scutomyia, Stegomyia, Tanakaius, Udaya, Vansomerenis, Verrallina (and subgenera Harbachius and Neomacleaya), Zavortinkius and Zeugnomyia. In addition, the monophyly of Tewarius, newly added to the data set, is confirmed. Heizmannia (Mattinglyia) and Verrallina (Verrallina) were found to be paraphyletic with respect to Heizmannia (Heizmannia) and Verrallina (Neomacleaya), respectively. The analyses were repeated with the 14 characters derived from length measurements treated as ordered. Although somewhat different patterns of relationships among the genera and subgenera were found, all were recovered as monophyletic taxa with the sole exception of Dendroskusea stat. nov.

Due to the unavailability of specimens for study, many species of Stegomyia are without subgeneric placement. As is usual with generic-level groups of Aedini, the newly recognized genera and subgenera are polythetic taxa that are diagnosed by unique combinations of characters.

Using bamboo traps, we sampled macroinvertebrate communities in a habitat within the subtropical cloud forest of Henri Pittier National Park, Rancho Grande, north-central Venezuela, and quantified the temporal differences in their abundance and composition. In total, 1024 invertebrates were collected during the 7 months between February and August 2008.

The traps also contained predators, detritivores and collectors (filtering and gathering). Macroinvertebrate abundance in the traps was higher during the rainy season. This observation was attributed to a greater abundance of Ephydridae, Blattaria and Culicidae during wetter months, and an increased availability of potential new breeding sites in the environment, which resulted in increased adult eclosion, and higher rates of oviposition in the bamboo traps.

Data description: Detailed morphometric data on the striking leg 'paddle' ornament of the sabethine mosquito Sabethes cyaneus: ornament size and shape and size of general morphological traits. Data derive from 80 males and 80 females from a wild-type laboratory colony established with individuals collected in Panama. Search method: Shape variation was analysed using geometric morphometric methods (elliptic Fourier analyses). We investigated sex differences in the relationships between body size on the one hand and leg length, ornament size, and ornament shape on the other, using general linear models. We also explored morphological variation in asymmetry, allometry, and in the magnitude of phenotypic variation across traits. Conclusions: These ornaments showed many of the classic hallmarks of a sexually selected and condition-dependent ornament: (i) phenotypic variation in size was much greater than for any other trait; (ii) the size of the major part of the paddle showed positive allometry; and (iii) the degree of fluctuating asymmetry in one component of the shape of the leg paddles decreased with body size. Remarkably, these patterns were more pronounced in females and sexual dimorphism in size and shape of the leg paddle ornament was slight. Although data on the current pattern of morphological variation alone does not allow firm conclusions about past selection, our results are consistent with the maintenance of these ornaments in both sexes by sexual selection via mutual mate choice.","Arnqvist, G.; South, S.H.","","11",2009,"","","","","","","","",""

Yellow fever is a serious illness public health importance and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Haemagogus and Sabethes in the rural and forest environments, and by Aedes aegypti in the urban setting. In Colombia, Haemagogus janthinomys and H. equinus are considered efficient vectors of this viral disease. Objective. The presence of the mosquito Haemagogus equinus was recorded over an 8 year period, in the periurban areas of the Soledad and Malambo municipalities (Atlantico Province) of northern Colombia. Materials and methods. The data was obtained from records of the entomological collections from two collection sites: (1) 14 larva traps located at the Erneasto Cortissoz airport in the municipality of Soledad between 1997-2005 and (2) 10 larva traps located at Vergara and Velasco Batallion in the municipality of Malambo in 2005. Results. Haemogogus equinus was reported for the first time in Soledad in 1998. In the following 8 years, 197 larvae were reported. The individuals were found sharing the trap with Aedes aegypti, Culex nigripalpus and Uranotaenia lowii. In Malambo, the first discovery of H.equinus occurred in 2005, with a total of 641 larvae. No other Culicidae were associated with it. Conclusion. The presence of H. equinus in larvitraps located near the urban zone, shows adaptation to the use of artificial containers as larval habitats, Urbanization of this species in zones with a high Ae. aegypti infestation index increases the potential introduction of sylvan yellow fever virus and constitutes a risk for re-emergence of urban cycles of yellow fever.","Bello-Novoa, B.; Berrueco-Rodriguez, G.; Brochero, H.; Maestre-Serrano, R.; Vergara-Sanchez, C.","","28",2008,"","Bellow-Novoa_2008_Presence_of_Haemagogus_equinus_Theobald_1903_Diptera-_Culicidae_in_Soledad_and_Malambo_in_the_Province_of_Atlantico_Colombia.pdf","Wrong species ","","","","","",""

Although specific mechanisms vary, many such explanations propose some vicariance in the distribution of species during glacial cycles and several have been supported by genetic evidence in Neotropical taxa. However, no consensus exists with regard to the extent or time frame of the vicariance events. Here, we analyse the cytochrome oxidase II mitochondrial gene of 250 Sabethes albiprivus B mosquitoes sampled from western Sao Paulo in Brazil. There was very low population structuring among collection sites (ΦST=0.03, P=0.04). Historic demographic analyses and the contemporary geographic distribution of genetic diversity suggest that the populations sampled are not at demographic equilibrium. Three distinct mitochondrial clades were observed in the samples, one of which differed significantly in its geographic distribution relative to the other two within a small sampling area (∼70 x 35 km). This fact, supported by the inability of maximum likelihood analyses to achieve adequate fits to simple models for the population demography of the species, suggests a more complex history, possibly involving disjunct forest refugia. This hypothesis is supported by a genetic signal of recent population growth, which is expected if population sizes of this forest-obligate insect increased during the forest expansions that followed glacial periods. Although a time frame cannot be reliably inferred for the vicariance event leading to the three genetic clades, molecular clock estimates place this at ∼1 Myr before present. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Butlin, R.K.; Pedro, P.M.; Sallum, M.A.","","101",2008,"","Butlin_2008_Forest-obligate_Sabethes_mosquitoes_suggest_palaeoecological_perturbations.pdf","Wrong species ","","","","","",""

The ingroup comprises 54 species and the outgroup includes four non-aedine species and 100 aedine species, 21 of which were previously classified as incertae sedis. Data are analysed in a total-evidence approach using implied weighting. The analysis produced 158 most parsimonious cladograms. The strict consensus tree (SCT) corroborates the monophyly of the 30 generic-level taxa recognized previously that are included in the analysis. Overall, the results show remarkable congruence with those obtained previously despite differences in the taxa and morphological characters analysed in this and the two previous studies. All species of Ochlerotatus s.s., subgenus 'Ochlerotatus' sensu auctorum, Geoskusea, Levua, Pseudoskusea and Rhinoskusea included in the analysis fall within a single clade that is treated as genus Ochlerotatus; thus, the last four taxa are restored to their previous subgeneric rank within this genus. Nine additional subgenera, of which four are new, are proposed for monophyletic clades of Ochlerotatus species based on the strength of character support and application of the principle of equivalent rank. Acartomyia stat. nov., Culicelsa stat. nov., Gilesia stat. nov., Protoculex stat. nov. and Chrysoconops stat. nov. are resurrected from synonymy with Ochlerotatus; and Empihals subgen. nov.

(Finlaya)' and 'Oc. (Protomacleaya)'. Based on previous observations, refined relationships and new character support, three additional genera are recognized for species previously included in 'Finlaya', i.e. Danielsia stat. nov.

(type species: Aedes seoulensis Yamada) are introduced as subgenera of Collessius and Hopkinsius, respectively. As is usual with generic-level groups of Aedini, the newly recognized genera and subgenera are polythetic taxa that are diagnosed by unique combinations of characters. The analysis corroborates the previous observation that 'Oc.

As a result, some species may be forced to move to other places or become locally extinct. Based on these changes, some species can be used as bioindicators of environmental degradation. The aim of this study was to assess Culicidae composition and richness in two Atlantic Forest sites (Carvalho and Trilha; State of Paraná, Brazil), and to evaluate whether they can be used as indicators of environmental degradation of these sites. Culicidae samplings were performed between December 2002 and May 2003, using a manual electric aspirator. The study identified 48 species and 636 specimens of Culicidae. Species composition and species richness of Culicidae differed between the two studied forest fragments, possibly as a result of the varying conservation levels of theses sites. The higher values of richness observed in Carvalho, as well as the predominance of species from the Sabethini tribe and Kerteszia species, indicate reduced human interference in this forest fragment. In contrast, species composition and reduced richness in Trilha indicate a high level of environmental degradation.","Do Anjos, A.F.; Navarro-Silva, M.A.","","30",2008,"","Do_2008_Culicidae_Insecta-_Diptera_in_areas_of_Atlantic_Forest_Parana_State_Brazil.pdf","Wrong species ","","","","","",""

A laboratory assay was developed aiming at standardizing the biotin-avidin sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which was unprecedented for mosquito blood meal identification. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) activity was evaluated by the detection of titers on each sample of the 28 blood-fed Culex quinquefasciatus. In light of the high sensitivity that the technique permits, by means of small quantities of specific antibodies commercially provided and phosphatase substrate which reinforces additional dilutions, human and rat blood meals were readily identified in all laboratory-raised Culex quinquefasciatus tested. The assay was effective to detect human blood meal dilutions up to 1:4,096, which enables the technique to be applied in field studies. Additionally, the present results indicate a significant difference between the detection patterns recorded from human blood meal which corroborate the results of host feeding patterns.","Consales, C.A.; Gomes, A.C.; Marassá, A.M.; Rosa, M.D.B.","","14",2008,"","Consales_2008_Biotinavidin_sandwich_enzyme-linked_immunosorbent_assay_for_culicidae_mosquito_blood_meal_identification.pdf","Wrong species ","","","","","",""

Serum samples collected at four days and two months after the onset of the symptoms and examined by hemagglutination inhibition test, revealed monotypic seroconversion to MAYV. Isolation of the virus was obtained from one of the samples by inoculation of the first blood samples into newborn mice. A suspension of the infected mouse brain was inoculated into C6/36 cells culture and the virus was identified by indirect immunofluorescent assay with alphavirus polyclonal antibodies. RT-PCR, performed with RNA extracted from the supernatant of C6/36 infected cells in the presence of alphavirus generic primers as well as specific MAYV primers, confirmed these results. The reported cases illustrate the importance of laboratory confirmation in establishing a correct diagnosis. Clinical symptoms are not always indicative of a disease caused by an arbovirus.

The behavior is compatible with published results of mark-release-recapture studies, although many of these have been interpreted as evidence for limited dispersal. Skip oviposition also extends the duration of the gonotrophic cycle, the key parameter in the use of parous rates to estimate physiologic age. In addition, contact with multiple oviposition sites was probably a factor in the remarkable success of ""perifocal"" treatments with DDT in the campaign to eradicate Ae. aegypti from the Americas and the mobility of the vector probably limits the efficacy of attempts to suppress dengue transmission by source reduction and ""focal"" treatments with aerosols.

Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, yellow fever (YF) is considered a reemerging disease owing to its increased incidence in the past 25 years. Molecular epidemiologic data suggest there are seven genotypes of YFV that are geographically separated, and outbreaks of disease are more associated with particular genotypes. In addition, the risk of urban YF, owing to transmission of the virus by Aedes aegypti, is increasing in Africa, as is the potential of urban YF returning to South America.

We sampled the contents of natural water-filled tree holes in the three habitat types and quantified differences in the abundance, species richness and composition of their macroinvertebrate communities. We additionally placed experimental tree-hole analogs (water-filled bamboo [Guadua sp.] internodes) in each of the habitat types and sampled their macroinvertebrate communities over 110 d. The species composition of macroinvertebrates in both tree holes and bamboo sections differed among habitats. Larvae of damselflies and crane flies, both important predators of mosquitoes, were replaced by larvae of the predatory mosquito Toxorhynchites spp. in chacras. Several mosquito species were relatively more abundant in chacra habitat. Macroinvertebrate abundance and species richness were correlated with water volume in tree holes and varied over time in bamboo sections. Species richness in bamboo did not differ among the three focal habitat types, but forest tree holes contained more species than tree holes in chacras.

The American (AM) genotype of dengue serotype 2 has been endemic in the Western Hemisphere and South Pacific, causing outbreaks of dengue fever (DF), but has not been linked to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The Southeast Asian (SEA) genotype of dengue was introduced into this hemisphere in 1981, has caused outbreaks with numerous cases of DHF, and has displaced the AM genotype in several countries. We investigated the effect of viral genotype on the potential for transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in South Texas with six viruses, representing these two genotypes. Viral replication in the midgut was significantly higher in SEAinfected mosquitoes, and virus-specific proteins could be detected in salivary glands 7 days earlier in SEA- than AM-infected mosquitoes. This much earlier appearance of dengue virus in salivary glands resulted in an estimated 2- to 65-fold increase in the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes for the viruses that can cause DHF. This may be one of the mechanisms through which more virulent flaviviruses spread and displace others globally.

The ingroup comprises 74 species, including 41 currently classified as 'Finlaya', 25 formerly placed in this group and eight related species. The outgroup includes four non-aedine species and 38 aedine species representing all generic-level taxa of the polyphyletic 'Ochlerotatus' and major clades within the polyphyletic 'Aedes' in figure 4 of Reinert et al. (2004). Data are analysed in a total-evidence approach using implied weighting. The analysis produced four most parsimonious cladograms and ambiguity among the four is relatively minor concerning just four parts of the cladograms, two of which are linked. The strict consensus tree corroborates the monophyly of the 13 genera proposed by Reinert et al. (2004) that are included in the analysis. Overall, the results show remarkable congruence with those of Reinert et al. (2004) despite differences in the taxa included and morphological characters examined in the two studies. Seventeen genera, of which 11 are new, are proposed for monophyletic clades based on the strength of character support and application of the principle of equivalent rank.

With the purpose of presenting exact description of acarine eggs, it is preferable to examine them both with and without SEM processing. SEM processing caused partial removal of the chorion which makes the egg shell clear and easily observed. The study revealed rough surface of egg shell which was surrounded by the chorion. The egg shell was perforated particularly at poles. The chorion appeared as a finely perforated cloth. Different forms of bumps were noticed between egg shell and chorion. Length, width, l/w ratio and pore diameter of the egg were measured. SEM investigation of the larva revealed smooth scutum with slight irregular ornamentation and horizontally folded extensible cuticle with vertical ridges. At least 2 types of cuticular openings were noticed on the extensible cuticle of the idiosoma. The first type was represented by 1 pair on dorsal side and 2 pairs on ventral one. It was surrounded with thick integumental ring and guarded with 2 internal lips. The second type was numerous, slit-like and without rings or lips. Dorsolateral plate of the hypostome carried numerous oval, tile-like and elevated denticles while ventral one carried 4 rows of posteriorly directed retrograde conical denticles.

Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy was used to determine the relative abundance of five alkanes in hexane extracts from the legs of individual mosquitoes. Age-related changes to relative hydrocarbon abundances were observed from An. farauti and Ae. aegypti, which are vectors of malaria and dengue, respectively. Female An. farauti were classified into two age categories (1-5 and ≥ 5 days old at 27°C) and Ae. aegypti into three age categories (1 to < 5, 5 to < 9 and ≥ 9 days old at 27°C) based on these changes. However, there was an absence of predicable age-related changes to hydrocarbon abundance in Oc. vigilax. Simulation modeling was used to construct sequential sampling guidelines for the application of this technique to estimate the survivorship of Ae. aegypti and An. farauti populations. These guidelines define the relationship between the survival rate, number of mosquitoes sampled, CH-based predictions of age, and the accuracy of survival rate estimates. They demonstrated, for example, that if 19% of a population of Ae. aegypti is estimated to be ≥ 9 days old by CH analysis, an estimate of the daily survival rate from the exponential model should be based on a sample of 200 mosquitoes for the survival rate estimate to be within 5% of the actual rate. However, if only 10% of the population is estimated to be ≥ 9 days old, 500 mosquitoes would need to be analyzed for the survival rate estimate to be of equivalent accuracy.

In this review I describe these interactions in the families of flies that contain blood-feeding species. A transition from the aerial swarm, with rapid copulae and no direct female choice, to substrate-based systems with lengthy copulae and opportunities for female choice is evident at both a phylogenetic scale and within nematoceran families under specific ecological conditions. Female monogamy is associated with the former, polyandry with the latter. I suggest that the intensity of sexual selection operating on males in systems where the probability of mating is low has favored male ability to control female receptivity. Reproductive success of males is universally correlated to successful foraging for sugar or blood and (in some species and ecological conditions) to body size. Understanding the ecological basis of the mating systems of these flies will help formulate integrative, sustainable, and biologically lucid approaches for their control.

Field research and laboratory investigations related to the three components of this unique mode of transmission, virus, vector, and vertebrate host, have produced an enormous amount of valuable information that may be found in numerous publications. However, despite many reviews on specific viruses, diseases, or interests, a systematic approach to organizing the available information on all facets of biological transmission and then to interpret it in the context of the evolutionary process has not been attempted before. Such an attempt in this review clearly demonstrates tremendous progress made worldwide to characterize the viruses, to comprehend disease transmission and pathogenesis, and to understand the biology of vectors and their role in transmission. The rapid progress in molecular biologic techniques also helped resolve many virologic puzzles and yielded highly valuable data hitherto unavailable, such as characterization of virus receptors, the genetic basis of vertebrate resistance to viral infection, and phylogenetic evidence of the history of host range shifts in arboviruses. However, glaring gaps in knowledge of many critical subjects, such as the mechanism of viral persistence and the existence of vertebrate reservoirs, are still evident. Furthermore, with the accumulated data, new questions were raised, such as evolutionary directions of virus virulence and of host range. Although many fundamental questions on the evolution of this unique mode of transmission remained unresolved in the absence of a fossil record, available observations for arboviruses and the information derived from studies in other fields of the biological sciences suggested convergent evolution as a plausible process. Overall, discussion of the diverse range of theories proposed and observations made by many investigators was found to be highly valuable for sorting out the possible mechanism(s) of the emergence of arboviral diseases.","Chang, G.-J.J.; Kuno, G.","","18",2005,"","","","","","","","",""

Laboratory analysis of 26 virgin mating pairs partly confirms and greatly extends an earlier description suggesting that males perform a courtship ritual. A male approaches a female by hovering behind her, moving toward her from one side, reaching toward her and occasionally touching her with his closest midleg, and eventually seizing her wing with that midleg and inverting beneath her, forelegs against the substrate. Immediately after male alignment with the female, the pair enters a superficial genital-coupling phase, in which the male's extended gonostyli are linked to the female, and he proceeds sequentially through four stages of midleg oscillations (MLOs): Alternate I, Synchronous I, Double-flex, and Synchronous II. Following one or more genital thrusts, the pair shifts to a full-copulation phase, which lasts only up to 6 s, during which the genitalia are clasped and insemination occurs. The male raises his midlegs and hindlegs in succession, then performs Alternate II MLO until the female kicks him and he is released. Nineteen (73%) of the 26 pairs successfully completed the entire sequence, including genital shift and full copulation, taking an average of 3.7 min. Features of the display that might determine success were not evident. Reversions in the chain of events occurred, but linear progression of stages and phases was characteristic of nearly all matings. The male's approach, however, lacked stereotypic form and probably is not part of the courtship. © 2005 The Royal Entomological Society.","Foster, W.A.; Hancock, R.G.; Zsemlye, J.L.","","19",2005,"","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, the closely related Haemagogus equinus densovirus (HeDNV) causes dramatic cytopathic effects in the C6/36 Aedes albopictus cell line. Infection of C6/36 cells by HeDNV causes internucleosomal fragmentation of host chromosomal DNA, changes in cellular morphology (membrane budding, apoptotic bodies), caspase activation and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cellular membrane. This is accompanied by a higher rate of infection and more vigorous production of virus in these cells. These observations are consistent with the induction of apoptosis during infection. In contrast, expression of AeDNV proteins in C6/36 cells does not cause obvious cytopathic effects although NS1 expression causes accumulation of cells in G2 phase. C6/36 cells persistently infected with AeDNV were not protected from superinfection with HeDNV. Thus, there does not seem to be an antiviral state induced by AeDNV persistent infection. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In 2003, the rainy season began with heavy rains and, as a result, temporary ponds, the breeding places for mosquitoes, were flooded at their maximum level immediately. In such conditions, Aedes vexans arabiensis populations are abundant at the very beginning of the season, when the majority of eggs in quiescence are flooded. Females, hatching from eggs laid the year before, quickly lay eggs on the pond's wet soil, which will undergo dormancy as the water level goes down. Rainless periods longer than seven days, the time needed for embryogenesis, followed by significant rainfall, will result in the hatching of very large numbers of new eggs. Thus, several generations of adults may exist during the same rainy season. Because of potential vertical transmission of Rift Valley Fever virus in Aedes species, viral transmission and disease risk can appear as early as the beginning of the rainy season and if late rains occur, at the end of the season. This dynamic maximizes the virus' chance to persist from one year to another, thus facilitating endemisation of Rift Valley Fever in areas where Aedes vexans arabiensis exists.","Chevalier, V.; Diaïté, A.; Fall, A.G.; Lancelot, R.; Mondet, B.; Ndiaye, M.; Ndione, J.-A.; Ponçon, N.","","30",2005,"","","","","","","","",""

The mosquito Ochlerotatus triseriatus is an efficient vector for La Crosse virus, whereas the closely related O. hendersoni transmits only at very low rates. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the ability to orally transmit this virus and adult body size were identified in 164 F2 female individuals from interspecific crosses of O. hendersoni females and O. triseriatus males using a combination of composite interval mapping (CIM), interval mapping (IM) for binary traits, and single-marker mapping. For oral transmission (OT), no genome locations exceeded the 95% experimentwise threshold for declaring a QTL using IM, but single-marker analysis identified four independent regions significantly associated with OT that we considered as tentative QTL. With two QTL, an increase in OT was associated with alleles from the refractory vector, O. hendersoni, and likely reflect epistatic interactions between genes that were uncovered by our interspecific crosses. For body size, two QTL were identified using CIM and a third tentative QTL was identified using single-marker analysis. The genome regions associated with body size also contain three QTL controlling OT, suggesting that these regions contain either single genes with pleiotropic effects or multiple linked genes independently determining each trait.

In total, 172 characters were examined for 119 exemplar species representing the existing 12 genera and 56 subgenera recognized within the tribe. The data for immature and adult stages were analysed separately and in combination using equal (EW) and implied weighting (IW). Since the classification of Aedini is based mainly on adult morphology, we first tested whether adult data alone would support the existing classification. Overall, the results of these analyses did not reflect the generic classification of the tribe. The tribe as a whole was portrayed as a polyphyletic assemblage of Aedes and Ochlerotatus within which eight (EW) or seven (IW) other genera were embedded. Strict consensus trees (SCTs) derived from analyses of the immature stages data were almost completely unresolved. Combining the adult and immature stages data resulted in fewer most parsimonious cladograms (MPCs) and a more resolved SCT than was found when either of the two data subsets was analysed separately. However, the recovered relationships were still unsatisfactory. Except for the additional recovery of Armigeres as a monophyletic genus, the groups recovered in the EW analysis of the combined data were those found in the EW analysis of adult data. The IW analysis of the total data yielded eight MPCs consisting of three sets of two mutually exclusive topologies that occurred in all possible combinations. We carefully studied the different hypotheses of character transformation responsible for each of the alternative patterns of relationship but were unable to select one of the eight MPCs as a preferred cladogram. Overall, the relationships within the SCT of the eight MPCs were a significant improvement over those found by equal weighting. Aedini and all existing genera except Ochlerotatus and Aedes were recovered as monophyletic. Ochlerotatus formed a polyphyletic assemblage basal to Aedes. This group included Haemagogus and Psorophora, and also Opifex in a sister-group relationship with Oc. (Not.) chathamicus. Aedes was polyphyletic relative to seven other genera, Armigeres, Ayurakitia, Eretmapodites, Heizmannia, Udaya, Verrallina and Zeugnomyia. With the exception of Ae. (Aedimorphus), Oc. (Finlaya), Oc. (Ochlerotatus) and Oc. (Protomacleaya), all subgenera with two or more species included in the analysis were recovered as monophyletic. Rather than leave the generic classification of Aedini in its current chaotic state, we decided a reasonable and conservative compromise classification would be to recognize as genera those groups that are 'weighting independent', i.e. those that are common to the results of both the EW and IW analyses of the total data. The SCT of these combined analyses resulted in a topology of 29 clades, each comprising between two and nine taxa, and 30 taxa (including Mansonia) in an unresolved basal polytomy. In addition to ten genera (Armigeres, Ayurakitia, Eretmapodites, Haemagogus, Heizmannia, Opifex, Psorophora, Udaya, Verrallina and Zeugnomyia), generic status is proposed for the following: (i) 32 existing subgenera of Aedes and Ochlerotatus, including nine monobasic subgenera within the basal polytomy, i.e. Ae. (Belkinius), Ae. (Fredwardsius), Ae. (Indusius), Ae. (Isoaedes), Ae. (Leptosomatomyia), Oc. (Abraedes), Oc. (Aztecaedes), Oc. (Gymnometopa) and Oc. (Kompia); (ii) three small subgenera within the basal polytomy that are undoubtedly monophyletic, i.e. Ae. (Huaedes), Ae. (Skusea) and Oc. (Levua), and (iii) another 20 subgenera that fall within the resolved part of the SCT, i.e. Ae. (Aedes), Ae. (Alanstonea), Ae. (Albuginosus), Ae. (Bothaella), Ae. (Christophersiomyia), Ae. (Diceromyia), Ae. (Edwardsaedes), Ae. (Lorrainea), Ae. (Neomelaniconion), Ae. (Paraedes), Ae. (Pseudarmigeres), Ae. (Scutomyia), Ae. (Stegomyia), Oc. (Geoskusea), Oc. (Halaedes), Oc. (Howardina), Oc. (Kenknightia), Oc. (Mucidus), Oc. (Rhinoskusea) and Oc. (Zavortinkius). A clade consisting of Oc. (Fin.) kochi, Oc. (Fin.) poicilius and relatives is raised to generic rank as Finlaya, and Downsiomyia Vargas is reinstated from synonymy with Finlaya as the generic name for the clade comprising Oc. (Fin.) leonis, Oc. (Fin.) niveus and their relatives. Three other species of Finlaya - Oc. (Fin.) chrysolineatus, Oc. (Fin.) geniculatus and Oc. (Fin.) macfarlanei - fall within the basal polytomy and are treated as Oc. (Finlaya) incertae sedis. Ochlerotatus (Ochlerotatus) is divided into three lineages, two of which, Oc. (Och.) atropalpus and Oc. (Och.) muelleri, are part of the basal polytomy. The remaining seven taxa of Oc. (Ochlerotatus) analysed, including the type species, form a reasonably well-supported group that is regarded as Ochlerotatus s.s. Ochlerotatus (Rusticoidus) is retained as a subgenus within Ochlerotatus s.s. Ochlerotatus (Nothoskusea) is recognized as a subgenus of Opifex based on two unique features that support their sister-group relationship. A new genus, Tanakaius gen. nov., is proposed for Oc. (Fin.) togoi and the related species Oc. (Fin.) savoryi.

To facilitate discussion among taxonomists, medical entomologists, ecologists, and vector control specialists, it is essential that culicidologists be able to readily recognize individual genera. Adult female mosquitoes, the stage most often encountered in surveys, should be identifiable to genus without dissection with the aid of a good-quality dissecting microscope. Female adult specimens of Ochlerotatus and Aedes as defined by Reinert cannot be identified morphologically without dissection, and no distinct differences in biology, behavior, and ecology distinguish these 2 taxa as currently defined. Use of these names as genera complicates mosquito identification and interferes with information retrieval and communication among taxonomists, medical entomologists, and vector control specialists. Therefore, it is our opinion that Ochlerotatus Lynch Arribalzaga should be placed as a subgenus of Aedes Meigen, Aedes (Ochlerotatus).

Female resistance to males is proposed to be driven by the direct advantage to the female of avoiding male-imposed reductions in the number of offspring she can produce, rather than by the indirect advantage of selecting among possible sires for her offspring, as in some traditional models of sexual selection by female choice. This article uses the massive but hitherto under-utilized taxonomic literature on genitalic evolution to test, in a two-step process, whether such new models of arms races between males and females have been responsible for rapid divergent evolution of male genitalia. The test revolves around the prediction that 'new arms races' are less likely to occur in species in which females are largely or completely protected from unwanted sexual attentions from males (e.g. species which mate in leks or in male swarms, in which males attract females from a distance, or in which females initiate contact by attracting males from a distance). The multiple possible mechanical functions of male genitalia are summarized, and functions of male genitalic structures in 43 species in 21 families of Diptera are compiled. Functions associated with intromission and insemination (e.g. seizing and positioning the female appropriately, pushing past possible barriers within the female, orienting within the female to achieve sperm transfer), which are unlikely to be involved in new arms races when females are protected, are shown to be common (>50% of documented cases). This information is then used to generate the new arms race prediction: differences in genitalic form among congeneric species in which females are protected should be less common than differences among congeneric species in which females are vulnerable to harassment by males. This prediction was tested using a sample of 361 genera of insects and spiders. The prediction clearly failed, even when the data were adjusted to take into account several possible biases. Comparative analyses within particular taxonomic groups also failed to show the predicted trends, as did less extensive data on other non-genitalic male display traits. Arms races, as defined in some recent models, seem to have been less important in male-female coevolution of genitalic structures than has been suggested. By elimination, alternative interpretations, such as traditional female choice, which do not predict associations between female protection from harassment and rapid divergent evolution, are strengthened.","Eberhard, W.G.","","79",2004,"","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of life tables by the key-factor method showed that mortality caused by desiccation of breeding sites was the principal factor accounting for fluctuations in population sizes throughout the study period. For cohorts that completed development, mortality attributed to predation by aquatic insects ranged from 68 to 96% and was the most important cause of death. In these cohorts, final population size was determined by the high mortality rates that occurred during the fourth larval instar and pupal stages; however, the key-factor best accounting for the population fluctuations was predation of fourth instar larvae. The short mean time of 7.1 days for synchronous development of the larvae and the lack of evidence of density-dependent mortality suggested that the A. scapularis populations were not strongly regulated and can attain relatively high densities.","Casanova, C.; Do Prado, A.P.","","92",2002,"","","","","","","","",""

After ingesting 104.3 CCID50/mosquito, mosquitoes reared at 18 and 25°C (and held at the same temperature) had higher body remnant and head and salivary gland titers than those held at 32°C, although infection rates were comparable. At 18, 25, and 32°C, respectively, virus was first detected in the salivary glands on days 3, 2, and 3. Based on a previously demonstrated 98.7% concordance between salivary gland infection and transmission, the extrinsic incubation periods were estimated as 5, 4, and 3 d, respectively, for these three temperatures. When Oc. vigilax reared at 18, 25, or 32°C were fed a lower dosage of 1033 CCID50 RR/mosquito, and assayed after 7 d extrinsic incubation at these (or combinations of these) temperatures, infection rates and titers were similar. However, by 14 d, infection rates and titers of those reared and held at 18 and 32°C were significantly higher and lower, respectively. However, this process was reversible when the moderate 25°C was involved, and intermediate infection rates and titers resulted. These data indicate that for the strains of RR and Oc. vigilax used, rearing temperature is unimportant to vector competence in the field, and that ambient temperature variations will modulate or enhance detectable infection rates only after 7 d extrinsic incubation. Because of the short duration of extrinsic incubation, however, this will do little to influence RR epidemiology, because by this time some Oc. vigilax could be seeking their third blood meal, the latter two being infectious.","Jennings, C.D.; Kay, B.H.","","39",2002,"","","","","","","","",""

To achieve it, 1875 bamboo internodes aligned vertically in live green, bamboo plants Merostachys speciosa Munro and Merostachys sp. were used, in which metabolic water was exuded from the plant itself, and presenting different size/pattern holes at their lateral walls, bored by the local sylvan fauna. Another group of 1200 individual internode traps was used as comparative element, carved out with a transversal cut by a saw, filled with local stream water and held in branches at different heights in the vegetal strata nearby. At both microhabitat types, a total of 17 culicid species was registered. Culex (Microculex) neglectus Lutz, 1904, Cx.

This study has added to our knowledge of the epidemiology of yellow fever and enabled us to redefine epidemiological zones and determine their geographical limits. The endemic area is located within the Amazon basin; here cases are scattered and generally limited in number. However, there are also ""foci of endemic emergence"" within this area, where cases are less rare, although occurrence remains irregular. The epidemic area is for the most part situated outside the Amazon basin, to the north east and particularly to the south. It has been divided into two parts according to whether the occurrence of yellow fever is cyclic or sporadic. The epidemics, which are all sylvatic, follow either a circular path (in the forest area) or a linear path (in forest-galleries of the savannah area). The study of the development of the 3 main epidemics (1972-74; 1979-82; 1986-92) in the cyclic emergence area showed that, on each occasion, the yellow fever virus appeared at a particularly active outbreak site located in the ""serra dos Carajás"", and from there, it followed the courses of the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers upstream, moving southwards during the ""pre-epidemic phase"" which may be visible due to the occurrence of a few cases, or may remain invisible. Subsequently the virus reached the emergence area, where it appeared in the form of epidemics. In this zone, it also followed privileged south-western pathways, moving from one hydraulic basin to another along the upstream courses of the rivers. Almost exactly the same pathways have been identified for each of the 3 epidemics studied. The distances travelled by the virus over a period of one year - when it goes rapidly - can reach several hundred kilometres. On the other hand, it may be stationary for a period of one or two consecutive years, occasionally three, remaining present in the area but infecting humans only rarely if at all. The virus occasionally leaves the cyclic emergence area and appears in the sporadic emergence area to the east, in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais and São Paulo, and, as a consequence, moving onto other hydraulic basins. The small river basins in Maranhäo and Northwest states, as well as in the northern part of the state of Roraima also form part of the sporadic emergence area. The epidemics that occur here are directly linked to the endemic area and are only preceded by sometimes indiscernible epizootics and can consequently not be foreseen. Again the virus appears to use privileged pathways to reach the sporadic emergence areas where human and monkey populations are generally only partially immunised against yellow fever and where contact with mosquitoes is intense despite the fact it is limited in space and time, being restricted to the often narrow strip of trees along the water courses. Other routes used by the virus may be the Madeira, Xingu and Tapajós rivers, the scene of outbreaks observed in the state of Rondônia and in the north of Mato Grosso, where ongoing environmental changes are likely to result in an increasing number of outbreaks in the coming years. Since the discovery of the sylvatic cycle of yellow fever in 1933, not only the extent of the epidemiological areas has changed, but also their limits. Ecological modifications that are currently taking place in the Amazon basin, which is an endemic reservoir of the virus, will inevitably facilitate an increase the contact between humans and vectors. While more and more urban areas harbour populations of Aedes aegypti, the domestic and urban vector of yellow fever, it is particularly important to try to protect human populations living in emergence zones and epidemic areas and thus to prevent the arrival of the virus in towns via humans with viremia - in other words the much feared urbanisation of yellow fever in Brazil.","Mondet, B.","","94",2001,"","","","","","","","",""

The first cases were reported 1 week after New Year's day and originated at Chapada dos Veadeiros, a tourist canyon site in Goiás state, near Brasília, the Brazilian capital. The laboratory procedures used for diagnoses included serology with an IgM capture assay and plaque reduction neutralization test, virus isolation in suckling mice and C6/36 cells, and immunohistochemistry. All cases were diagnosed by at least two different laboratory procedures, with the exception of the first three fatal cases, which were diagnosed on the basis of clinical and epidemiological information. The cases were reported in eight Brazilian states as follows: Goiás with 64.9% (50 cases); Amazonas (1); Bahia (10); Distrito Federal (1); Mato Grosso (4); Minas Gerais (2); Pará (1); São Paulo (2); and Tocantins (6). Patient ages were within the following ranges: 13-74 years old (mean 34.3), 64 (84.4%) were male, especially agricultural workers (n =30), but tourists (n = 11), carpenters (n = 4), fishermen (n = 4), students (n = 3), truck drivers (n = 3), and other people (n = 22) were also sickened. The case fatality rate was 50.6% (39/77). In Bahia state, a serologic survey that was carried out has suggested a symptomatic/asymptomatic coefficient of 1:4. Field studies developed in Distrito Federal, Goiás, and São Paulo states showed that Haemagogus janthinomys was the mosquito species associated with the transmission. A single strain was also obtained from Aedes scapularis in Bahia. Epizootic occurrence (monkey mortality) was observed in 49 municipalities mainly in Goiás state, where 40 municipalities made reports, 21 of which also diagnosed human cases. Data obtained by the National Institute of Meteorology in Brazil showed an increase in temperature and rain in December 1999 and the first 3 months of 2000 in Goiás and surrounding states, which perhaps has contributed to the intense and widespread transmission of the yellow fever virus. The relatively small number of cases probably reflects the extensive use of yellow fever 17D-vaccine during the last 3 years, in which about 45 million doses were used. During the last months of 1999, 16 and 11 yellow fever cases were reported in Tocantins and Goiás states, respectively. It is noteworthy that the last reported autochthonous cases of sylvatic yellow fever in São Paulo and Bahia, both states outside the endemic/enzootic area, had occurred in 1953 and 1948, respectively. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Barbosa Da Silva, J.; Barros, V.L.R.S.; Costa, Z.G.; Cruz, A.C.R.; Dias, J.P.; Luna, E.; Martins, E.C.; Monteiro, H.A.O.; Oliva, O.F.P.; Oliveira, R.C.; Rodrigues, S.G.; Sousa, M.R.S.; Travassos Da Rosa, E.S.; Travassos Da Rosa, J.F.S.; Vasconcelos, H.B.; Vasconcelos, P.F.C.","","65",2001,"","Barbosa_2001_Epidemic_of_jungle_yellow_fever_in_Brazil_2000-_Implications_of_climatic_alterations_in_disease_spread.pdf","No location data ","","","","","",""

Following intraperitoneal inoculation of a virulent strain of YF virus, hamsters developed a high-titered viremia (up to 109/mL) lasting 5-6 days and abnormal liver function tests. YF hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies appeared 4 or 5 days after infection, often while viremia was still present. The mortality rate in YF-infected hamsters was variable, depending on the virus strain and the age of the animals. Clinical and pathologic changes in the infected hamsters were very similar to those described in experimentally infected macaques and in fatal human cases of YF, which indicates that the golden hamster may be an excellent alternative animal model, in place of nonhuman primates, for research on the pathogenesis and treatment of YF and other viscerotropic flavivirus diseases.","Bunnell, J.E.; Dias, L.B.; Guzman, H.; Tesh, R.B.; Travassos Da Rosa, A.P.A.; Vasconcelos, P.F.C.; Xiao, S.-Y.; Zhang, H.","","183",2001,"","","","","","","","",""

To identify the etiologic agent associated with this illness, mosquitoes and serum samples were collected in the endemic area. Methods The study area corresponded to four municipalities of Paraná State, Brazil. Mosquitoes were captured in Shannon trap and human bait. After identification, they were processed for virus isolation. Blood of equities were collected in the municipalities of Querência do Norte and Colorado. Antibodies to different Alphavirus and Flavivirus were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition test. Specific seroneutralization reactions were performed in those sera with a positive reaction in the hemagglutination test. Results The mosquitoes genus collected were: Culex, Aedes, Mansonia, Coquillettidia, Psorophora, Sabethes, Wyeomyia, and Limatus. Even thought no virus was isolated, serologic analyses showed hemagglutinazing antibodies to Eastern equine encephalitis, Mucambo, Pixuna, Maguari, and St Luis encephalitis viruses. The neutralization test showed specific reaction to Eastern equine encephalitis virus in 12 tested sera. Conclusions Species of mosquitoes that could be potential vectors of encephalitis, buniavirus, and other arboviruses of epidemiological importance were collected. It is believed that Eastern equine encephalitis virus affected the equines populations in the study regions because of the symptoms and antibodies for the virus in the sera detected in these equines.","Fernández, Z.; Richartz, R.; Soccol, V.T.; Travassosa Da Rosa, A.","","34",2000,"","Fernandez_2000_Identification_of_the_encephalitis_equine_virus_Brazil.pdf","No location data ","","","","","",""

Consistent with studies by Sato in the 1950s, we find that dark-active and crepuscular species have short fused rhabdoms with a conical construction. This maximises the amount of light the rhabdoms receive from the almost hemispherical wide-aperture lenses. Toxorhynchites, on the other hand, has long narrow rhabdomeres that are separated from each other over their entire length, and so resemble the open rhabdoms of advanced flies (Brachycera and Cyclorrhapha). These findings are confirmed by studies of the pseudopupil, whose form indicates the layout of the rhabdomere tips in the focal plane of each ommatidial lens. In anopheline species the pseudopupil is a single undivided ellipse, indicating a fused rhabdom structure, whereas in Toxorhynchites there is a ring of six outer elements surrounding a central one. This means that each rhabdomere views a separate direction in space, and our measurements indicate that, as in higher Diptera, adjacent rhabdomeres share their fields of view with one of the rhabdomeres in the immediately adjacent ommatidia. This in turn means that in the diurnal type of mosquito eye there is a basis for neural superposition, but the fused construction of anopheline rhabdoms precludes this. The Aedes species studied were similar to Anopheles but with lenses of less extreme aperture, and Sabethes cyaneus, a diurnal blood-feeder, was intermediate in structure, with fused conical rhabdoms in the centre of the eye and unfused rhabdomeres around the periphery.","Gibson, G.; Horwood, J.; Land, M.F.; Zeil, J.","","185",1999,"","","","","","","","",""

The recapture rates were high, 4.9 and 13.1% for Haemagogus and Sabethes spp., respectively. For Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar, females were recaptured until 27 d after release. The duration of the gonotrophic cycle was between 5.0 and 9.5 d and the survival rate was 0.90-0.92. Haemagogus leucocelaenus (Dyar & Shannon) was recaptured once, 21 d after release. Twelve Sabethes chloropterus (Von Humboldt) were recaptured, with a peak at 15-18 d; 1 female was recaptured at 44 d, indicating extended survival. Seven Sabethes amazonicus Gordon & Evans and 7 Sabethes cyaneus (F.) were recaptured, mostly at 14-39 d. These results indicate that Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. have a gonotrophic cycle in nature longer than inferred from laboratory studies, and that cycle length varies seasonally.

New and traditional morphological characters studied and compared throughout the Culicidae resulted in the acquisition of character data relative to the majority of species within each genus. Polymorphisms and morphological observations are discussed and additional information and illustrations are provided for the majority of characters and their character states. The analysis of seventy-three adult, pupal and fourth-instar larval characters coded for the thirty-eight currently recognized genera of mosquitoes resulted in relationships and groupings which differ significantly from traditional hypotheses. The analysis supports the monophyly of the subfamily Anophelinae and the tribes Culicini and Sabethini. The Anophelinae form the most basal clade of the family. The results indicate that Aedini is a paraphyletic assemblage with respect to the Mansoniini, each of which is monophyletic in itself. The Aedini + Mansoniini form a sister group to the Culicini + Sabethini, with the Aedini and the Culicini placed in ancestral relationships to the Mansoniini and the Sabethini, respectively. Based on the topography of generic relationships among more 'generalized' mosquitoes, the boundaries and relationships of the tribes Aedeomyiini, Uranotaeniini, Ficalbiini, Hodgesiini, Orthopodomyiini and Culisetini appear to be problematic. Relationships between genera of the tribe Aedini are generally poorly resolved due to a significant amount of polymorphism, especially within the genus Aedes as currently defined. There is no support for separate subfamily recognition for the genus Toxorhynchites, which is downgraded to tribal status as a result of the analysis.

Initial tests failed to find congruence between characters partitioned by life stage. However, when components from the combined analysis were tested using reduced taxon sets, a high degree of concordance between partitions was observed. A procedure for assessing individual life-stage contribution is employed, in which exhaustive searches are used to explore all possible arrangements for each of the selected components. Seven of the 10 components examined were able to recover the combined topology with a reduced taxon set. Congruent arrangements of taxa were typically observed for two or more life stages, although partitioned data were less resolved and frequently included aberrant topologies (those not supported by other partitioned or combined reduced taxon tree sets). In addition, none of the partitioned data sets gave robust results for all tests, suggesting that studies which emphasize character data from single life stages may support misleading arrangements of taxa. One component on the combined cladogram was not supported by any of the life-stage partitions when analysed separately.

Medically important insects, particularly mosquitoes, are among those more thoroughly described by conventional taxonomy, and thereby provide a secure framework for testing congruencies with molecular data. In turn, molecular investigations have provided a stimulus to vector systematics in the discovery and delineation of cryptic species complexes, as well as providing new perspectives on relationships at higher taxonomic divisions.

Relationships among 13 species representing three subfamilies and nine genera of Culicidae were analyzed using a 762-bp fragment of coding sequence from the eye color gene, white. Outgroups for the study were two species from the sister group Chaoboridae. Sequences were determined from cloned PCR products amplified from genomic DNA, and aligned following conceptual intron splicing and amino acid translation. Third codon positions were characterized by high levels of divergence and biased nucleotide composition, the intensity and direction of which varied among taxa. Equal weighting of all characters resulted in parsimony and neighbor-joining trees at odds with the generally accepted phylogenetic hypothesis based on morphology and rDNA sequences. The application of differential weighting schemes recovered the traditional hypothesis, in which the subfamily Anophelinae formed the basal clade. The subfamily Toxorhynchitinae occupied an intermediate position, and was a sister group to the subfamily Culicinae. Within Culicinae, the genera Sabethes and Tripteroides formed an ancestral clade, while the Culex- Deinocerites and Aedes-Haemagogus clades occupied increasingly derived positions in the molecular phylogeny. An intron present in the Culicinae- Toxorhynchitinae lineage and one outgroup taxon was absent in the basal Anophelinae lineage and the second outgroup taxon, suggesting that intron insertions or deletions may not always be reliable systematic characters.","Besansky, N.J.; Fahey, G.T.","","14",1997,"","","","","","","","",""

Vector-pathogen interactions are reviewed briefly as a prelude to a discussion of the genetics of susceptibility and refractoriness in vectors. Susceptibility to pathogens is controlled by maternally inherited factors, sex-linked dominant alleles, and dominant and recessive autosomal genes. There is widespread interpopulation (including inter-colony) and temporal variation in susceptibility to pathogens. The amount of biochemical genetic variation in vectors is similar to that found in other invertebrates. However, the amount varies widely among species, among populations within species, and temporally within populations. Biochemical genetic studies show that there is considerable genetic structuring of many vectors at the local, regional, and global levels. It is argued that genetic variation in vectors is critical in understanding vector-pathogen interactions and that genetic variation in vectors creates both obstacles to and opportunities for application of genetic techniques to the control of vectors.","Gooding, R.H.","","9",1996,"","","","","","","","",""

The results are interpreted in relation to the degree of degradation reported for each forest in the collecting sites, allowing the selection of species or groups of species that act as good indicators of local environmental changes. By this approach the different localities were scaled along a gradient of anthropogenic modifications correlated with a particular mosquito fauna. The resulting model allows to classify different woods in southeastern Brazil according to their state of preservation, by means of their mosquito species. Four bioindicators for the particular levels of forest degradation in southeastern Brazil are proposed: Kerteszia, Aedes scapularis, Mansoniini and Haemaaogus.","Dorvillé, L.F.M.","","31",1996,"","","","","","","","",""

Immature stage habitats were described and classified according to the following criteria: natural or artificial; size; location related to light and neighboring houses; vegetation; water: permanence, movement, turbidity and pH. Four groups of species were associated based on the habitat similarity by means of cluster analysis: Aedes albifasciatus, Culex saltanensis, Cx. mollis, Cx. brethesi, Psorophora ciliata, Anopheles albitarsis, and Uranotaenia lowii (Group A); Cx. acharistus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. bidens, Cx. dolosus, Cx. maxi and Cx. apicinus (Group B); Cx. coronator, Cx. chidesteri, Mansonia titillans and Ps. ferox (Group C); Ae. fluviatilis and Ae. milleri (Group D). The principal component analysis (ordination method) pointed out that the different types of habitats, their nature (natural or artificial), plant species, water movement and depth are the main characters explaining the observed variation among the mosquito species. The distribution of mosquito species by phytogeographic region did not affect the species groups, since species belonging to different groups were collected in the same region.","Almirón, W.R.; Brewer, M.E.","","91",1996,"","","","","","","","",""

Five distinct waveform patterns were identified: secretion of sheath saliva (salivation), nonvascular probing, nonsieve element ingestion, x-waveform, and phloem ingestion. Waveforms were associated with feeding activities by correlation with light microscopic examination of salivary sheath termination points in leaf tissue and analysis of honey-dew excreted by monitored leafhoppers. In previous studies x-waveforms have been reported to occur only when the stylets of homopterans are in contact with the phloem; the function of x-waveforms is poorly understood. There were no differences in time spent salivating or ingesting from nonsieve elements among G. nigrifrons, G. oquaka and A. grex on either plant. D. maidis differed from other species in phloem probing and feeding behavior; only a small proportion produced x-waveforms, although those that did spent significantly more time in this behavior than other species. Also, D. maidis spent more time than other leafhoppers ingesting from tissues other than sieve elements. Kinetic diagrams of transition probabilities show that probing activities of all species were not random regarding the sequence of behaviors culminating in phloem ingestion. Thirty-five percent of G. nigrifrons x-waveforms were followed by nonsieve element ingestion. This was consistent with observations showing that salivary sheaths of leafhoppers producing x-waveforms sometimes do not terminate in the phloem, but rather in nearby cells. Phloem ingestion was always preceeded by x-waveforms. The quantitative differences in probing behavior are discussed in relation to ability of these leafhoppers to transmit the phloem-associated maize chlorotic dwarf waikavirus. © 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Nault, L.R.; Wayadande, A.C.","","9",1996,"","","","","","","","",""

The male performs an elaborate sequence of pre-copulatory courtship, during which he secretes a liquid substance from the cephalic gland and uses it as a courtship gift to entice females to mate. The female allows the male to copulate with her, only after she has successfully obtained the gift. Females continue to assess the mate quality even after genitalic intromission has begun and mate rejection by females is common during copulation as well as during pre-copulatory courtship. The majority of prematurely terminated copulations occur before sperm are transferred. Mating pairs usually copulate three or more times in succession and the entire sequence of courtship is repeated prior to each copulation. Females that mated three or more times lay considerably more eggs than those mated only once or twice, suggesting that sufficient sperm supplies are required for females to achieve full fecundity. By copulating repeatedly with the same male, females could obtain courtship gifts at a greater rate than mating multiply with different males because the courtship duration with the same male decreases significantly after the first copulation. Observations on females that mated with multiple males suggest that such females may copulate repeatedly with a preferred male in order to dilute the sperm from inferior males and thus affect the paternity of offspring. © 1995.","Choe, J.C.","","49",1995,"","","","","","","","",""

These viruses are among the most important arthropod-borne viruses worldwide and include dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Morbidity and mortality caused by these viruses vary, but collectively they account for millions of encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, arthralgia, rash, and fever cases per year. Most of the members of this family are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by arthropod vectors, most commonly mosquitoes or ticks. Transmission cycles can be simple or complex depending on the hosts, vectors, the virus, and the environmental factors affecting both hosts and viruses. Replication of virus in invertebrate hosts does not seem to result in any significant pathology, which suggests a close evolutionary relationship between virus and vector. Another example of this relationship is the ability of these viruses to grow in invertebrate cell culture, where replication usually results in a steady state, persistent infection, often without cytopathic effect. Yields of virus from insect cell culture vary but are generally similar to yields in vertebrate cells. Replication kinetics are comparable between insect and vertebrate cell lines, despite differences in incubation temperature. Both vertebrate and insect cell culture systems continue to play a significant role in flavivirus isolation and the diagnosis of disease caused by these agents. Additionally, these culture systems permit the study of flavivirus attachment, penetration, replication, and release from cells and have been instrumental in the production and characterization of live-attenuated vaccines. Both vertebrate and insect cell culture systems will continue to play a significant role in basic and applied flavivirus research in the future. © 1993 Tissue Culture Association.","Iacono-Connors, L.C.; Ludwig, G.V.","","29",1993,"","","","","","","","",""

Courtship in all species occurred both prior to and following intromission, with most courtship being performed after the male had achieved intromission. Females often prevented males from mounting, and often prevented mounted males from achieving intromission. They also probably often prevented male genitalia from penetrating past the vulva, even after they had allowed them into the genital chamber. Males at least sometimes pushed forcefully at structures both on the surface of the female and within her reproductive tract. Copulation probably involved a combination of force and persuasion. It often failed to result in complete transfer of sperm. Males displayed striking virtuosity in both the morphology and behavior of their genitalia, which assumed at least four different morphological configurations. At least five and perhaps up to eight different functions were performed by male genitalia. Small sacs near the tips of the male parameres were probably used by males as ""foot-in-the-door"" devices to gain access to the female’s genital chamber, while the spiney collar and tongue may have helped open the vulva to allow deeper penetration. The energetic and persistent courtship which occurred after intromission was achieved may lunction at least partly to induce the female to allow the male to reach the deeper stage of penetration necessary for spermatophore formation, and perhaps to permit transfer of sperm to her spermathecal duct. Male courtship behavior included movements of his head, vibration and sweeping. movements of his middle legs, rubbing with his abdominal bristles against the female’s elytra, strong substrate vibrations of unknown origin in the male’s body, and tapping and stroking with his genitalia on the external surface of the female’s abdomen while he held her with his specialized front legs.

Partitioning electromorph data for the chromosomal forms reduces the mean FIS to 0.03 (SD 0.01), which suggests that positive assortative mating is a characteristic of each form. This supports the hypothesis that the chromosomal/electrophoretic forms A, B, C and D represent four distinct biological species within the An.dirus complex.

General observation led to a classification of movement into path, frequency, position and mechanism. Examination of high speed film sequences (64 frames per second) revealed that all species use the same basic mechanism of flexing, which consists of a power and a recovery phase. The entire flexing cycle is a modification of undulatory propulsion commonly observed in other animals (e.g., snakes, ceratopogonid larvae). Variations on the basic patterns of mosquito larval flexing mainly concern the speed of the power stroke and the degree of sinusoid curvature prior to the power stroke. Four basic patterns of larval flexing were discerned: irregular, sinuous, semisymmetric and anopheline. Some taxonomic groups appear to use one pattern of flexing exclusively or with few exceptions. Examples include Culex (Melanoconion) with sporadic irregular flexing, Cx. (Culex) with sustained irregular flexing, Haemagogus with slow sinuous flexing and Anopheles with anopheline flexing. Other groups (e.g., Aedes (Howardina), Cx. (Carrollia), Deinocerites, and Wyeomyia (Wyeomyia] use a number of patterns of flexing. Observation of flexing and other aspects of larval movement can be an important addition to geographical, habitat and morphological considerations in field identifications.","Strickman, D.","","5",1989,"","","","","","","","",""

Well-developed polytene chromosomes were discovered in the larval salivary glands and a photomap standard was constructed. Clear banding patterns and consistent landmarks distinguished each of the six arms. Substantial asynapsis occurred in the three polytene chromosomes, although the banding pattern of the homologous regions appeared homosequential. A nucleolar organizer was localized in region 5A of the shortest chromosome by the recurrent association of this region with the nucleolus. The large band in region 5A was found heterozygous for width and a deletion. Additional, less conspicuous, polymorphisms for band width and staining intensity were distributed throughout the genome.

Nine isolations of the agent were made from 1,688 Haemagogus spp. caught within or near forests from 27 January to 3 March 1973. Seven of these isolations came from mosquitoes collected on the forest floor. No YF virus isolation was made from 791 Haemagogus leucocelaenus or 1,096 Sabethes chloropterus. Haemagogus were caught both in and outside houses located 500 m from the forest, although at a lower rate than in the forest. Haemagogus collection rates in a secondary growth forest were similar to or even higher than those in primary forests. YF virus was recovered from a Cebus monkey and hemagglutination-inhibition and/or neutralizing antibody to YF virus was found in seven (30.4%) of 23 primates examined. There was, however, little evidence of sick or dying monkeys. Among other wild-caught animals only a single marsupial (Caluromys) had antibodies to the virus.

Over 9,000 insects representing 26 species were assayed in 396 pools for the presence of arboviruses. Pools of Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar yielded the only isolates of either MAY or YF virus. The minimum field infection rate for nine isolates of MAY virus from Hg. janthinomys was 1:82, and for two isolates of YF virus was 1:368. Analysis of collection data showed Hg. janthinomys to be attracted to man as a blood source and present in all habitats sampled, although most abundant in the forest canopy. Twelve hundred bird sera and 584 mammal sera were tested by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests for antibody to MAY virus. Highest MAY antibody prevalence rates were found among marmosets (Callithrix argentata, 32 positive of 119 tested, 27%). Mayaro virus was also isolated from the blood of a sylvan marmoset captured at the peak of the MAY virus outbreak. Experimental infection of marmosets with MAY virus confirmed that a substantial viremia follows infection with this virus. Marmosets were also found with HI antibody to YF virus (5/119, 4%). The results presented indicate that Hg. janthinomys was the principal vector of both MAY and YF viruses and that marmosets were the main amplifying hosts for MAY virus, and perhaps for YF virus as well.","Hoch, A.L.; LeDuc, J.W.; Peterson, N.E.; Pinheiro, F.P.","","30",1981,"","Hoch_1981_An_outbreak_of_Mayaro_virus_disease_in_Belterra_Brazil._III._Entomological_and_ecological_studies.pdf","No location data ","","","","","",""

WEE appears to exist endemically in numerous foci in that region, with a low incidence rate among humans. Severe outbreaks, however, have occurred periodically. For example, during 1941 a severe epidemic involving more than 3000 cases in humans occurred in North Dakota, Minnesota, and in the adjacent areas of Canada. The case fatality rate ranged from 8% to 15%. Epizootics among horses are more common. More than 600 cases of WEE were diagnosed among horses in the central and western United States during 1975. More recently, the virus of WEE has been found to be widely distributed in the eastern United States in regions along the Atlantic and Gulf seaboard; however, WEE has not been recognized as a public or veterinary health problem in the east. This situation presents an interesting epidemiological problem: a virus present in the different regions is causing disease in one area but not another area even though susceptible hosts are present. The reasons for the absence of WEE in humans and equines in the east are not clearly understood but probably are a reflection of parallel variations in the enzootic transmission cycles of this virus in different regions of the United States. Several reviews are available on the ecology of WEE virus in the areas of the western United States.

Mosquito densities are very low in the dry season (April-May), rapidly increasing with the main rains which begin about late May-June, and continuing probably considerable until the following April-May dry season. Diurnal, crepuscular and nocturnal activity, and vertical distribution in forest, resembled findings from elsewhere in Middle America. The coastal pest, Aedes taeniorhynchus, occurred in small numbers as far inland as 45 miles. The Aedes terrens group includes a new species, Ae. bertrami Schick 1970. Mansonia dyari and Ae. cozumelensis first described, respectively, from Jamaica in 1970 and from the Yucatan in Mexico in 1966, were taken, and also Ae. vexans, common in North America. Differentiation within C. (Mel.) opisthopus/taeniopus is still inconclusive, available larvae and ♂ genitalia being assigned to C. (Mel.) n. sp. near paracrybda. Ae. aegypti was not found, following an eradication programme. The anopheline and culicine species include, respectively, vectors of malaria and of arboviruses. As a result of a malaria eradication campaign, few cases of malaria occur.

The distribution and bionomics of the elements of the sylvan mosquito fauna and the mammals of the region, which are most likely to be related to the maintenance of the yellow fever cycle, are summarized. The following epidemiological conclusions are suggested. (1) It is proposed that in the past there have been circumscribed and self-limiting episodes of sylvan yellow fever in Middle America, which were seeded from urban Aedes aegypti-transmitted epidemics. These epizootics were limited in extent and duration because of the marginal effectiveness of the sylvan mosquito fauna as vectors. (2) Localized outbreaks, by reducing the size of the susceptible primate pool, precluded the possibility of any general sustained wave of sylvan yellow fever. The elimination of urban yellow fever at about the end of the first quarter of this century permitted the susceptible primate host population to build up to densities capable of maintaining the recent wave of yellow fever during a 6-year period. (3) The passage of virus across the Canal Zone on to the Atlantic slope of western Panama, and so into Central America, is attributed to the coincidence of the arrival of a virus wave at this zone of marginal ecology during a period of climatic conditions particularly favorable for forest canopy mosquitoes. (4) It is suggested that transmission of yellow fever by Sabethes chloropterus, which persists through dry season, is the key to the survival of virus during this unfavorable time of year. (5) The apparent end of the yellow fever wave in northern Honduras in 1954 is thought most likely to have been due to a severe and unusual drought during the first half of 1955. © 1956, All rights reserved.","Galindo, P.; Trapido, H.","","5",1956,"","","","","","","","",""

A review of their insect and vertebrate hosts and the mechanisms for survival and dispersion","The present review deals primarily with vectors, vertebrate hosts, and mechanisms for maintenance and dispersion of the mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses (western equine, eastern equine, St. Louis, Japanese, Murray Valley, and Venezuelan). The Venezuelan virus is restricted to tropical areas, western and St. Louis viruses to temperate zones, and the eastern, Japanese, and Murray Valley viruses occur in both tropical and temperate zones, although the latter two agents are found primarily in the temperate zone. The five agents important in the temperate zones are ecologically associated with birds and, except for eastern equine virus, with Culex mosquitoes. The common factors in the maintenance and dispersion of these viruses may be sought in the association of virus, birds, and Culex mosquitoes. The eastern equine virus has been isolated from birds, and there is abundant evidence to indicate that they play some part in the circulation of this virus. There is no evidence of its occurrence in Culex mosquitoes, but epidemiological observations indicate that Aedes sollicitans may be a vector. Culex tarsalis has been definitely shown to be infected with virus throughout the area in which western equine encephalitis is found. This agent has been isolated repeatedly from birds. The bird-Culex tarsalis cycle appears to be adequately established in the case of this virus. Although the St. Louis virus has not been obtained directly from birds, there is sufficient evidence to implicate birds as being important in the ecological picture. The agent has been isolated several times from C. tarsalis and once from Aedes dorsalis and C. pipiens. On an epidemiological basis, the latter has been suggested as a vector. Japanese virus has not been isolated from birds, but serological evidence of previous infection of birds has been obtained. The majority of isolations of Japanese virus have been from Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Antibodies against Murray Valley virus have been detected in the sera of birds. On epidemiological grounds, Culex annulirostris is suspected of being important in the transmission of this virus. The evidence at hand, although it is not conclusive for the last named virus, indicates that there is an ecological relationship between the encephalitis viruses of temperate zones and mosquitoes and birds which accounts for the ability of these viruses to survive in cold climates. The single encephalitis virus (Venezuelan) restricted to tropical zones is thought to be transmitted by Mansonia tittilans, and no evidence has been obtained which would indicate that Culex species are involved. No evidence regarding the role of birds in the maintenance of this agent is available. Such mosquito-transmitted viruses as those of dengue and yellow fever, which occur primarily in tropical areas, are known to be transmitted by Aedes species and by Aedes and Haemagogus species, respectively. In general, Culex mosquitoes do not appear to be concerned with transmission of viral agents in the tropics. Much more field study is required before the ecological associations governing the presence of encephalitis viruses in the temperate zones can be considered to be firmly established. The available data suggest that there is a basic difference in the ecology of viruses of temperate and tropical zones and that further studies of ecological associations are justified. © 1954.","Eklund, C.M.","","3",1954,"","","","","","","","",""

Entomological studies conducted in large hydroelectric infrastructure projects are a tool for the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases. These diseases emerge as a consequence of changes made to the terrain that often increase the natural and artificial mosquito larval habitats. Many of these insects are of public health importance and population increases result in an increased risk of disease transmission. Objective. The culicine (mosquito) and phlebotomine (sand fly) populations were characterized in the area of the Porce II and Porce Ill hydroelectric projects of Antioquia between 1990 to 2009. Materials and methods. Periodical entomological samplings were made in the area of impact, in the workers camps, and construction sites. Adult specimens were captured with nets, Shannon light traps, CDC light traps, and protected human bait. Results. Mosquito larvae of the following species were identified: Culex coronator, Culex nigripalpus, Culex corniger, Culex quinquefasciatus and Limatus durhami. The most frequently identifiers of larval habitats were low tanks, waste cans, tires, and aquatic plants. Aedes aegypti specimens were captured in only two rural locations from two municipalities within the area of influence. Specimens from the following mosquito genera were captured in forest areas: Aedes, Mansonia, Culex, Psorophora, Wyeomyia, Phonyomyia, Uranotaenia, Haemagogus and Sabethes. The most important mosquito found was Haemogogus janthinomis, an efficient yellow fever vector in Colombia. The area has been endemic for leishmaniasis and in the current study, 20 species of Lutzomyia sand flies, potential vectors, were identified. Among malaria vectors, the most important species found in the area were Anopheles nuneztovari and Anopheles pseudopunctipennis. Conclusion. A wide variety of vectors were discovered in the area of the Porce II and Porce Ill hydroelectric projects, and many of these were relevant for public health. Further monitoring will be necessary to minimize disease transmission risks among the workers and the inhabitants of the surrounding areas.","Alonso Zuluaga, Walter; Claudia Gonzalez, Marta; Fernando Salazar, Luis; Isabel Wolff, Marta; Lucia Lopez, Yolanda; Osorio, Lisardo; Pablo Escobar, Jose; Rios, Claudia Maria","Biomedica","32",201,"","Twenty-year_surveillance_of_insects_relevant_to_public_health_during_the_construction_of_hydroelectric_facilities_in_Antioquia_Colombia_Alonso_Zuluaga.pdf","duplicate ","","","","","",""

The fear of the disease and the misinformation about its relationship with howler monkeys led inhabitants of several regions to exterminate these primates from the forests near their homes. In this paper we describe the theoretical background supporting the idea that howler monkeys play an important role in fighting yellow fever via the surveillance of virus circulation and stress that they are not responsible for the re-emergence of this African infectious disease, its transmission, or its fast spread through the highly fragmented landscape of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. We also describe how this scientific information has been used in the campaign ""Protect our Guardian Angels"" that was launched to inform the public and the media about the actual relationship of these regionally threatened species to the disease. The campaign is run and supported by educational, scientific, governmental (health- and environment-related) and religious institutions, and NGOs, an alliance in favor of biodiversity conservation and public health that has been effective in changing the quality of the news media, but that still requires a great effort to achieve the necessary level of population awareness.","Bicca-Marques, Julio Cesar; de Freitas, David Santos","Tropical Conservation Science","3",201,"","","","","","","","",""

Considering the ease of human movement into areas at risk of transmission and the tendency for these areas to expand, in time the entire country will probably need to adopt routine vaccination. However, in the decision on expanding the target population for vaccination, vaccine safety issues have been emphasized. We present a risk-benefit analysis of vaccination and strategies for controlling the disease and preventing its urbanization in regions where the vaccine is still not recommended. We conclude that inclusion of the yellow fever vaccine on the childhood immunization schedule is a proactive, easily operationalized strategy as a response to the increase in the number of cases of sylvatic yellow fever in Brazil, and an attempt at preventing re-urbanization of the disease.","Bastos Camacho, Luiz Antonio; de Noronha, Tatiana Guimaraes","Cadernos De Saude Publica","33",201,"","","","","","","","",""

Monthly culicidae samples were taken in six exploratory sites in the pre-filling period and in one fixed site, one year before (19971998) and after the first filling (1999-2000). Adult mosquitoes were captured in the morning with an aspirator and with Shannon and CDC traps during the evening twilight period. Immature stages were captured using a ladle in the larger breeding sites and with a pipette in the smaller ones. RESULTS: In the pre-filling period of the dam, a total of 944 immature culicidae specimens, from ten species, were captured. A total of 14,932 adults were captured, including 7,031 mosquitoes from ten species in the exploratory points and 7,901 specimens from eight genera in the fixed site. After the first stage of the dam filling, the immature stages total was 1,201, from four genera, and the captured mosquitoes total was 5,912, from nine genera. There was a population reduction of the genera Aedes and Psorophora and an increase of the following species populations: Aedeomyia, Anopheles, Culex (Melanoconion), Mansonia and Uranotaenia.

Specitic seroneutralization reactions were performed in those sera with a positive reaction in the hemagglutination rest. Results The mosquitoes genus collected were: Culex, Aedes, Mansonia, Coquillettidia, Psorophora, Sabethes, Wyeomyia and Limatus. Even thought no virus was isolated serologic analyses showed hemagglutinazing antibodies to Eastern equine encepha litis, Mucambo, Pixuna, Maguari, and St Luis encephalitis viruses. The neutralization test showed specific reaction to Eastern equine encephalitis virus in 12 tested sera. Conclusions Species of mosquitoes that could be potential vectors of encephalitis, buniavirus, and other arboviruses of epidemiological importance were collected. It is believed that East em equine encephalitis virus affected the equines populations in the study regions because of the symptoms mid antibodies for the virus in the sera detected in these equines.","Da Rosa, A.

Mosquito studies in the natural environment are of considerable importance because of their role in transmitting pathogens to both humans and other vertebrates. Community diversity can have significant effects on the risk of their disease transmission. The objective of this study was to understand the distribution of mosquito communities using oviposition traps in a region of the Atlantic Forest. Sampling was carried out in Bom Retiro Private Natural Reserve (RPPNBR), located in Casimiro de Abreu, Rio de Janeiro, using oviposition traps, which were set in the forest environment, from October 2015 to December 2016. The canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess the influence of the climatic variables (precipitation, maximum dew point, and direction) throughout the seasons on the population density of the mosquito species. The results showed that population density was directly influenced by climatic variables, which acted as a limiting factor for the mosquito species studied. The climatic variables that were significantly correlated with the density of the mosquito species were precipitation, maximum dew point, and direction. Haemagogus janthinomys was positively correlated with the three climatic variables, whereas Haemagogus leucocelaenus was positively correlated with precipitation and maximum dew point, and negatively correlated with direction.","Alencar, Jeronimo; Figueiro, Ronaldo; Freitas Silva, Shayenne Olsson; Maia, Daniele de Aguiar; de Mello, Cecilia Ferreira","Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases","18",201,"","Distribution_of_the_Mosquito_Communities_Diptera-_Culicidae_in_Oviposition_Traps_Introduced_into_the_Atlantic_Forest_in_the_State_of_Rio_de_Janeiro_Brazil_Shayenne_Olsson_Freitas_Silva.pdf","duplicate ","","","","","",""

Paulo, Brazil. Thus, collections of larvae and pupae mosquitoes were carried out at six sites distributed along a transection with a 10-km extension. The target was the treeholes but artificial containers were also used in this investigation. Aedes terrens and Ae. albopictus were the only species of genus Aedes present in the treeholes mentioned. The segregation of seven species of the treehole community was undertaken in the light of macrohabitat and microhabitat features. Thus, the distribution of Ae. albopictus was found to cover the rural, rural-urban and urban zones, but the rural-urban held the preference. Ae. albopictus never present in the residual and primary forest. The favorable, factor to infestation with Ae. albopictus in the Paraiba Valley seems to have been the large number of natural niches made vacant by human influence. The rain has been important in the production of larvae and pupae, but the rainfall period does not coincide with the maximum production on them. The treeholes whose volume exceeded 600 ml were the most productive breeding places. The abundance of these two stages occurs in the summer and autumn. However, the highest peak was observed in the months of March and April. These seasonal variations were found to be common in both the bamboo trap and the artificial container. The temperature data suggest a limit of from 17 to 23-degrees-C for the best development of larvae. In the light of this, the strain of Ae. albopictus studied seems to have originated in tropical Asia. Just as happened with Ae. aegypti it may become an important epidemiological vector for the dengue fever and provide links for yellow fever transmission in Brazil.","Debrito, M.; Forattini, O.

The disease is endemic in forest areas in Africa and Latin America leading to epizootics in monkeys that constitute the reservoir of the disease. There are two forms of YF: sylvatic, transmitted accidentally when approaching the forests, and urban, which can be perpetuated by Aedes aegypti. In Brazil, the last case of urban YF occurred in 1942. Since then, there has been an expansion of transmission areas from the North and Midwest regions to the South and Southeast. In 2017, the country faced an important outbreak of the disease mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. In 2018, its reach extended from Minas Gerais toward Sao Paulo. Yellow fever has an incubation period of 3 to 6 days and sudden onset of symptoms with high fever, myalgia, headache, nausea/ vomiting and increased transaminases. The disease ranges from asymptomatic to severe forms. The most serious forms occur in around 15% of those infected, with high lethality rates. These forms lead to renal, hepatic and neurological impairment, and bleeding episodes. Treatment of mild and moderate forms is symptomatic, while severe and malignant forms depend on intensive care. Prevention is achieved by administering the vaccine, which is an effective (immunogenicity at 90-98%) and safe (0.4 severe events per 100,000 doses) measure. In 2018, the first transplants in the world due to YF were performed. There is also an attempt to evaluate the use of active drugs against the virus in order to reduce disease severity.","Banks Ferreira Lopes, Max Igor; Gallafrio Novaes, Christina Terra; Litvoc, Marcelo Nobrega","Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira","64",201,"","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we assess vector competence of two sylvatic Neotropical mosquito species, Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Aedes terrens, to evaluate the risk of CHIKV to initiate a sylvatic cycle in the continent. Methodology/Principal findings Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Ae. terrens from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil were orally challenged with the two CHIKV lineages circulating in the Americas. Fully engorged females were kept in incubators at 28 +/- 1 degrees C and 70 +/- 10% humidity and examined at 3 and 7 days after virus exposure. Body (thorax plus abdomen), head and saliva samples were analyzed for respectively determining infection, dissemination and transmission. Both Hg. leucocelaenus and Ae. terrens exhibited high infection and dissemination rates with both CHIKV isolates at 7 dpi, demonstrating that they are susceptible to CHIKV, regardless of the lineage. Remarkably, Hg. leucocelaenus expectorated infectious viral particles as rapidly as 3 days after the infectious blood meal, displaying higher values of transmission rate and efficiency than Ae. terrens. Nevertheless, both species were competent to experimentally transmit both CHIKV genotypes, exhibiting vector competence similar to several American Aedes aegypti. Conclusions/Significance These results point out the high risk for CHIKV to establish a sylvatic transmission cycle in the Americas, which could be a serious health issue as CHIKV would become another zoonotic infection difficult to control in the continent.","Failloux, Anna-Bella; Lourenco-de-Oliveira, Ricardo","Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases","11",201,"","","","","","","","",""

Yellow fever is a serious illness public health importance and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Haemagogus and Sabethes in the rural and forest environments, and by Aedes aegypti in the urban setting. In Colombia, Haemagogus janthinomys and H. equinus are considered efficient vectors of this viral disease. Objective. The presence of the mosquito Haemagogus equinus was recorded over an 8 year period, in the periurban areas of the Soledad and Malambo municipalities (Atlantico Province) of northern Colombia. Materials and methods. The data was obtained from records of the entomological collections from two collection sites: (1) 14 larva traps located at the Erneasto Cortissoz airport in the municipality of Soledad between 1997-2005 and (2) 10 larva traps located at Vergara and Velasco Batallion in the municipality of Malambo in 2005. Results. Haemogogus equinus was reported for the first time in Soledad in 1998. In the following 8 years, 197 larvae were reported. The individuals were found sharing the trap with Aedes aegypti, Culex nigripalpus and Uranotaenia Iowii. In Malambo, the first discovery of H.equinus occurred in 2005, with a total of 641 larvae. No other Culicidae were associated with it. Conclusion. The presence of H. equinus in larvitraps located near the urban zone, shows adaptation to the use of artificial containers as larval habitats, Urbanization of this species in zones with a high Ae. aegypti infestation index increases the potential introduction of sylvan yellow fever virus and constitutes a risk for re-emergence of urban cycles of yellow fever.","Bello-Novoa, Betsy; Berrueco-Rodriguez, Guillermo; Brochero, Helena; Maestre-Serrano, Ronald; Vergara-Sanchez, Consuelo","Biomedica","28",200,"","","","","","","","",""

Methods CO2-baited CDC light traps were used for mosquito collection twice a month in the Serra do Cantareira State Park from February 2001 to January 2002. CO2-baited CDC light traps were placed in five different environments. The analyses were carried out using Margalef and Menhinick's diversity indexes. Similarity was calculated using the Sorensen index and species dominance was indicated by the Berger-Parker index. Mosquito heterogeneity was estimated using Simpson and Shannon indexes. The correlation between species dominance and climatic factors was estimated by Spearman coefficient. Results There were collected 2,219 Culicidae mosquitoes of 11 genera and 21 species. The forest environment showed the highest species richness (Mg=3.64) and the anthropic environment presented the most dominant species (d=0.85). Temperature showed the greatest positive correlation (Rs=0.747; p < 0.0001) when analyzing the relationship between climatic factors and number of individuals caught in the study area. Conclusions As the Serra do Cantareira State Park is a forest patch inserted in an urban environment, this may have changed the ecological relationships in the Culicidae breeding sites. The absence of Kerteszia subgenus and Culex quinquefasciatus species, in addiction to the presence of Sabethini Tribe specimens and Cx. (Mel.) vaxus species indicate that the Serra da Cantareira State Park is a forest section with sylvan features but show some anthropic interference.","Montes, J.","Revista de saude publica","39",200,"","Fauna_de_Culicidae_da_Serra_da_Cantareira_Sao_Paulo_Brasil_Culicidae_fauna_of_Serra_da_Cantareira_Sao_Paulo_Brazil_Joyce_Montes.pdf","","N/A","23° 22' S , 46° 36' W","N/A","d; /; m","y; e; s","n; o"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feeding habits of culicids potentially involved in the sylvatic transmission of the virus in this region. Methods: Specimens were collected in 24 forested localities at ground level with hand nets and mouth aspirators. Collections were made quarterly between October 2006 and July 2008 during daylight hours. Blood-meal identification was carried out in mosquitoes of the tribes Aedini, Mansoniini and Sabethini. The biotin/avidin sandwich ELISA was employed to determine six source types: bird, bovine, equine, rat, human and monkey. Results: A total of 24,879 females of the three tribes were obtained, 245 (0.98%) of which were engorged. The presence of three different blood sources per engorged female was the predominant situation, and included 35.10% of the total of samples processed. Samples with two or four different sources were represented by 25.31% and 25.71%, of the specimens, respectively, while just 9.39% had only one type and 1.22%, five different sources. Aedes scapularis, Ae. serratus (Group), Psorophora albigenu and Ps. ferox were the most abundant species and accounted for about 95% of the engorged specimens. Of the principal vector species, Haemagogus janthinomys/capricornii was found with bird, bovine and primate blood. These sources were predominant and alternated top ranking as the most frequent source according to the mosquito species and collection site. In general, primate blood was the most prevalent source. Conclusions: The human population of the region visits this ecotone frequently, which indicates the need for the periodical assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever. The frequency of non-human primate blood source in mosquito species that show minor vector importance in yellow fever virus transmission deserves attention. The eclectic feeding habits and some aspects of the interactions between potential vectors and reservoirs of yellow fever may be associated with the habitat fragmentation characteristic of the region. We recommend that further studies on the capacity and vector competence be performed on secondary vectors in extra-Amazonian region.","Cardoso Junior, Rubens Pinto; Consales, Cleide Aschenbrenner; Fernandes, Aristides; Mucci, Luis Filipe; Pacchioni, Macio Lunardeli; Salloum Scandar, Sirle Abdo; de Paula, Marcia Bicudo","Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins Including Tropical Diseases","21",201,"","Feeding_habits_of_mosquitoes_Diptera-_Culicidae_in_an_area_of_sylvatic_transmission_of_yellow_fever_in_the_state_of_Sao_Paulo_Brazil_Luis_Filipe_Mucci.pdf","Wrong species ","","","","","",""

Outbreaks have been localized and sporadic in the Pan-Amazonia forest since its first isolation in 1954 (Trinidad and Tobago). The literature available is scarce, diverse and dispersed. Mayaro virus is an alphavirus, phylogenetically related to the Semliki forest antigenic complex. UNA and Mayaro viruses are the only viruses of this complex that have been isolated in the New World. Mayaro consists of single-stranded RNA of positive charge, length of 12 kb, subdivided into genomic and subgenomic regions, which encode nonstructural and structural proteins respectively. Mayaro shows a great plasticity in vertebrate host infection, whereas high specificity in the family Culicidae (mosquitoes). Risk factors of infection are associated with forest areas of northern South America and the rainy season. Two genotypes of MAYV have been identified, L (Belterra, Brazil) and D (widely distributed in the Pan- Amazonia). The enzootic cycle is similar to the jungle cycle of yellow fever, which involves Haemagogus mosquitoes and monkeys as reservoirs. However, the involvement of other secondary vectors and other hosts may be important in spread of the virus. Humans may have high levels of viremia, and efficient experimental transmission has been demonstrated in Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Aedes scapularis, suggesting a significant risk to public health in urban, rural and peridomestic locations close to enzootic foci of Mayaro virus.","Carlos Navarro, Juan; Munoz, Manuel","Biomedica","32",201,"","","","","","","","",""

Although specific mechanisms vary, many such explanations propose some vicariance in the distribution of species during glacial cycles and several have been supported by genetic evidence in Neotropical taxa. However, no consensus exists with regard to the extent or time frame of the vicariance events. Here, we analyse the cytochrome oxidase II mitochondrial gene of 250 Sabethes albiprivus B mosquitoes sampled from western Sao Paulo in Brazil. There was very low population structuring among collection sites (Phi(ST) = 0.03, P = 0.04). Historic demographic analyses and the contemporary geographic distribution of genetic diversity suggest that the populations sampled are not at demographic equilibrium. Three distinct mitochondrial clades were observed in the samples, one of which differed significantly in its geographic distribution relative to the other two within a small sampling area (similar to 70 x 35 km). This fact, supported by the inability of maximum likelihood analyses to achieve adequate fits to simple models for the population demography of the species, suggests a more complex history, possibly involving disjunct forest refugia. This hypothesis is supported by a genetic signal of recent population growth, which is expected if population sizes of this forest-obligate insect increased during the forest expansions that followed glacial periods. Although a time frame cannot be reliably inferred for the vicariance event leading to the three genetic clades, molecular clock estimates place this at similar to 1 Myr before present.","Butlin, R.

Materials and methods: Adult Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes were collected via human landings simultaneously in the canopy and understory of three replicate high forest, white sand forest, and seasonally flooded forest sites near Iquitos, Peru. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded every 15 min. during the collection periods. Results: No Hg. janthinomys were collected in seasonally flooded forest. Their abundance was similar between high forest and white sand forest (Z = 1, 48; p = 0,14), but more individuals were encountered in the canopy (2.9; ± 0.89) than in the understory (0,4; ± 0.23) (Z = 2.80; p = 0,005). Hg. janthinomys abundance was not correlated with temperature or humidity (F1, 14 < 0.33; p 0057; r2 < 0.03). Conclusions: These preliminary results show that around Iquitos as in other regions, Hg. janthinomys are most abundant in the forest canopy. They also suggest that the probability of encountering Hg. janthinomys it can depends both on forest type and height of sampling within forests, but is not a function of temperature and humidity within the ranges commonly encountered in tropical forests.","Lounibos, L.

Vector surveillance and control activities are often focused at the household level. Little is known about the importance of nonhousehold sites, including schools, in maintaining vector-borne disease transmission. The objectives of this paper were to determine the mosquito species composition in rural schools in 2 municipalities in Colombia and to assess the potential risk of vector-borne disease transmission in school settings. Entomological surveys were carried out in rural schools during the dry and rainy seasons of 2011. A total of 12 mosquito species were found: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles pseudopunctipennis, Culex coronator, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Limatus durhamii in both immature and adult forms; Ae. fluviatilis, Cx. nigripalpus, Cx. corniger, and Psorophora ferox in immature forms only; and Ae. angustivittatus, Haemagogus equinus, and Trichoprosopon lampropus in adult forms only. The most common mosquito species was Cx. quinquefasciatus. Classrooms contained the greatest abundance of adult female Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The most common Ae. aegypti breeding sites were containers classified as ""others'' (e.g., cans), followed by containers used for water storage. A high level of Ae. aegypti infestation was found during the wet season. Our results suggest that rural schools are potentially important foci for the transmission of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases.

Results The eggs presented elliptical outlines of approximately 5 74 mm in length and 169 mm in width, with an egg index (l/w ratio) of 3.39 mm. The exochorion was extremely regular and had ornamentation that was usually hexagonal but sometimes pentagonal. Tubercles were observed on the chorionic cells, symmetrically arranged in relation to the longitudinal axis. Inside the cells, there were smaller individualized tubercles, some arranged peripherally and others grouped to a greater or lesser extent in the center The surface of the chorionic reticulum did not present rugosity. The micropylar apparatus was formed by a prominent continuous collar of 8.32 mm in thickness, with a slightly irregular surface. The micropylar disk was very evident, and was continuous with the collar The micropyle was seen at the center Of this disk, measuring 1.6 mm and with a micropylar apparatus of 27.3 mm in diameter Conclusions The ornamentation of the exochorion presents differences in relation to the tubercles of chorionic cells and the external chorionic reticulum between the eggs of Hg. Leucocelaenus, in comparison with the eggs of Hg. janthinomys and Hg. equinus, and also in relation to those of Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus and Ae bahamensis. In various aspects, the eggs of Hg. leucocelaenus have more resemblance to those of Hg. Equinus than those of Hg. janthinomys, with greater differences presented in relation to the eggs of Hg. spegazzinii and Hg. lucifer.","Alencar, J.; Degallier, N.; Guimaraes, A. E.; Lopes, C.

Among the reactive specimens, 174 (60.6%) fed on only one food source, of which 35.1% originated from birds, 19.5% from rodents, 12.6% from humans, 10.3% from cattle, 10.3% from opossums, 7.5% from dogs, and 4.6% from horses. One hundred six (37.0%) mosquitoes fed on two sources, of which the most common combinations were bird + rodent (16.0%), bird + human (10.4%), and horse + human (9.4%). Seven (2.4%) mosquitoes fed on three different hosts.

Evolutionary and structural analysis","Objective: To evaluate the evolution of the pathogen Mayaro virus, causing Mayaro fever (a mosquito-borne disease) and to perform selective pressure analysis and homology modelling. Methods: Nine different datasets were built, one for each protein (from protein C to non-structural protein 4) and the last one for the complete genome. Selective pressure and homology modelling analyses were applied. Results: Two main clades (A and B) were pointed in the maximum likelihood tree. The clade A included five Brazilian sequences sampled from 1955 to 2015. The Brazilian sequence sampled in 2014 significantly clustered with the Haitian sequence sampled in 2015. The clade B included the remaining 27 sequences sampled in the Central and Southern America from 1957 to 2013. Selective pressure analysis revealed several sites under episodic diversifying selection in envelope surface glycoprotein E1, non-structural protein 1 and nonstructural protein 3 with a posterior probability P <= 0.01. Homology modelling showed different sites modified by selective pressure and some protein-protein interaction sites at high interaction propensity. Conclusion: Maximum likelihood analysis confirmed the Mayaro virus previous circulation in Haiti and the successful spread to the Caribbean and USA. Selective pressure analysis revealed a strong presence of negatively selected sites, suggesting a probable purging of deleterious polymorphisms in functional genes.

The state of Mato Grosso do Sul is located between the tropical endemic region and the subtropical epidemic region and, despite being an area recommended for vaccination since the 1980s, human and animal cases of the disease are still registered. The purpose of this study was to present the results of entomological surveys of probable sites of infection (PSI) geographically describing these areas regarding human cases and disease suspicion reported in 2008. Thirteen locations in nine municipalities were investigated. A total of 305 females of the genus Haemagogus and Sabethes and five specimens of Aedes albopictus were obtained. The genus Haemagogus was more abundant but Sabethes presented twice as many species (3 x 6) and higher distribution within the collection points. The most abundant species was Hg. janthinomys, with 102 individuals in one location. The other species found were: Hg. leucocelaenus, Hg. spegazzinii, Sa. albiprivus, Sa. belisarioi, Sa. chloropterus, Sa. glaucodaemun, Sa. intermedius and Sa. soperi. It was not possible to identify predominant species in relation to environmental and geographical characteristics of the collection points. Of the nine human cases, eight corresponded to persons not resident in the State, seven of them tourists. MS features a large diversity of rural and wildlife tourist attractions where the yellow fever vectors described in this work are present. In this sense, the monitoring of vaccination coverage and flow of non- vaccinated people through the area are crucial to controlling the disease.","Batista, Paulo Mira; Faccenda, Odival; Mucci, Luis Filipe; Ramos, Ezequiel Pereira; da Silva, Jose Oliveira; de Almeida, Paulo Silva; de Oliveira Monteiro, Hamilton Antonio; de Paula, Marcia Bicudo","Revista de Patologia Tropical","45",201,"","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The studied area was the Porto Primavera dam construction site in Southeastern Brazil. Monthly culicidae samples were taken in six exploratory sites in the pre-filling period and in one fixed site, one year before (19971998) and after the first filling (1999-2000). Adult mosquitoes were captured in the morning with an aspirator and with Shannon and CDC traps during the evening twilight period. Immature stages were captured using a ladle in the larger breeding sites and with a pipette in the smaller ones. RESULTS: In the pre-filling period of the dam, a total of 944 immature culicidae specimens, from ten species, were captured. A total of 14,932 adults were captured, including 7,031 mosquitoes from ten species in the exploratory points and 7,901 specimens from eight genera in the fixed site. After the first stage of the dam filling, the immature stages total was 1,201, from four genera, and the captured mosquitoes total was 5,912, from nine genera. There was a population reduction of the genera Aedes and Psorophora and an increase of the following species populations: Aedeomyia, Anopheles, Culex (Melanoconion), Mansonia and Uranotaenia. CONCLUSIONS: The environmental changes caused due to the construction of the Porto Primavera Dam contributed to an increase in the population density of some culicidae vectors, causing a nuisance and the potential risk of the transmission of pathogens to humans.","Gomes, Almerio de Castro; de Paula, Marcia Bicudo","Revista de saude publica","41",200,"","","","","","","","",""

The survival rate (Ts = 0.96), the biting rate (0,60 mosquitoes/man x hour), and the infection rate (1.71 %) were also determinated for the same mosquitoes and have values compatible with the probable conditions of the human contamination. However, more data are needed, in particular in relation with other possible human contaminations and/or circulation of the YF virus in the monkey population (extension and duration of the epizootic episode), in order to know what maintenance cycle is prevalent in this region: a low level transmission, with the mosquito being a >, or a >, or a >.","Darosa, A.

The recapture rates were high, 4.9 and 13.1% for Haemagogus and Sabethes spp., respectively. For Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar, females were recaptured until 27 d after release. The duration of the gonotrophic cycle was between 5.0 and 9.5 d and the survival rate was 0.90-0.92. Haemagogus leucocelaenus (Dyar & Shannon) was recaptured once, 21 d after release. Twelve Sabethes chloropterus (Von Humboldt) were recaptured, with apeak at 15-18 d; 1 female was recaptured at 44 d, indicating extended survival. Seven Sabethes amazonicus Gordon & Evans and 7 Sabethes cyaneus (F.) were recaptured, mostly at 14-39 d.

Epizootics and epidemics have long been associated with the onset of the rainy season, when mosquito densities are higher. Thus, a more precise understanding of the relationship between rainfall and mosquito densities is necessary to evaluate the risk of transmission. Mosquitoes were collected when landing on a volunteer, almost daily for three hours, from 18 June, 1986 to 16 December, 1987, at canopy level, in a rainforest station in Eastern Brazilian Amazonia. A total of 4079 mosquitoes from 25 different species were captured during 547 collecting sessions, and Hg. janthinomys accounted for 18.78% (766 individuals). Cross-correlations were looked for between mosquito densities and rainfall, and auto-correlation calculations were carried out with the mosquito collection series. The first analysis showed a significant correlation index until the 55th day, with two peaks at 11-13 and 20-24 days. The auto-correlation of the mosquito series showed a regularly decaying correlation index, which remained significant until day lag 34. The study showed indirectly that under a rainforest rainfall regime, the development of female Hg. janthinomys from egg to adult takes 11-13 days.","Castro, Francisco C.; Da Silva, Orlando V.; De Oliveira Monteiro, Hamilton A.; Degallier, Nicolas; Elguero, Eric; Sa.

Strains from both areas, representing various topotypes, are distinct serologically, genetically and biochemically. In Africa, all vector mosquitoes are Aedes species, some related to the forest cycle and others responsible for the transmission in dryer areas. In South America, and particularly in Brazil, the main vector is Haemagogus janthinomys. Hg. albomaculatus has been incriminated in human peridomestic transmission in Central Amazonia. In the two continents, monkeys are the only regular vertebrate hosts of YF but the indigenous neotropical monkeys, show higher mortality rates. The South American and African vectors are diurnal and crespuscular/nocturnal in habit, respectively. The urban vector (Ae. aegypti) has the same habits in both continents, but its competence in transmitting the virus is very variable, and no urban epidemic has been notified in South America since the 40s. A general ecoepidemiological model was elaborated to explain the maintenance and circulation of YF virus in West and Central Africa, which are related to the phytoclimatical regions. Because no such hypothesis has yet been presented in the case of YF in South America, we tested this with the available data from Brazil. All occurrences (of which 386 were lab-confirmed) were distributed in five phytogeographical zones: dense rain forest (189), open rain forest (30), savannah with gallery forest (147), ecotones (10) and decidual seasonal forest (7). For each of these zones mean intervals between years with occurrences of YF were estimated. They were all found to be lower than 3 years, and lower than 5 years when standard deviation was added. Despite the close values obtained for the means, the distribution of the years as a function of number of occurrences of YF showed two groups: a) gallery forest and dense forest and b) open forest and ecotones. However, more data are necessary to enable the study of such variations which are thought to be related to ecological differences in YF transmission.","Barros, Vera L. R. S.

To date, 183 different types of arboviruses have been detected in the Amazonian region, accounting for more than one third of the 535 arboviruses reported in the world. Of these, 136 (74.3%) are endemic. The main objective of this paper was to evaluate what the effects of the construction and flooding of dams would be on the transmission and epidemiology of sylvatic arboviruses, in order to define the potential health hazards to which the human population would be subjected. Five areas were surveyed but only one could be thoroughly studied. Comparisons were made between surveys: i) inside the dam region, before, during and after the flooding period; ii) outside the dam region, in an area with a similar climate, landscape and vegetation, during the total time of the studies. The two chosen areas, namely Altamira and Tucurui, were studied since 1974, and since September, 1982, respectively. The former, and the latter before the outset of flooding (September 6, 1984) were considered as a control or reference for comparisons with data obtained in Tucurui during flooding and thereafter. The surveys consisted of sampling as many wild vertebrates and haematophagous Diptera as possible. Human sera were collected from febrile cases and random serological surveys. Very few variations seem to have occurred among the three phases of the study, with a maximum of positive serologies during the flooding period, but the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, in the reference region, the prevalence of antibodies against by the great proliferation of Anopheles nuneztovari and An. triannulatus which accompanied the flooding of the dam. An epizootic of the Gamboa virus (Bunyavirus, Gamboa serogroup), newly reported in Brazil, was observed one year after the outset of flooding, when the mosquito Aedeomyia squamipennis showed very large populations. Guaroa (Bunyavirus, California group), an endemic arbovirus, showed an epizootic probably as a consequence of the proliferation of anopheline mosquitoes. A temporary proliferation of Culex spp. mosquitoes and the presence of a rich avifauna in the dam area during flooding are probable causes of the enhanced circulation of Turlock (Bunyavirus, Turlock group) and Kwatta-like (Rhabdoviridae, Kwatta group) viruses. Oropouche (Bunyavirus, Simbu group), Saint Louis Encephalitis (Flavivirus, group B), Maguari/Xingu (two jointly studied Bunyavirus, group Bunyamwera), and Triniti (ungrouped Togaviridae) arboviruses showed at least patterns of enhanced circulation but probably for diverse reasons, not all due to the flooding of the dam. The last two types showed a possible shift of mosquito vectors, from diurnal ones to the nocturnal above cited anopheline. Eight arboviruses showed no clear-cut differences between their transmission patterns in the reference region and the ecologically modified dam area. They are: Yellow Fever (Flavivirus, group B), Mayaro (Alphavirus, group A), Ilheus (Flavivirus, group B), Tucunduba (Bunyavirus, Bunyamwera group), Eastern (and Western) Equine Encephalitis (Alphavirus, Group A), Icoaraci (Phlebovirus, Phlebotomus group), and Itaporanga (Phlebovirus, Phlebotomus group) viruses. The first six are pathogenic to man. The usefulness of classifying ecologically the arboviruses is highlighted, when studying or forecasting possible impacts of dam impoundment on human health hazards due to these agents. The scarcity of such studies does not allow comparisons for future studies, but it would be most important (i) to define the ecological characteristics of the new equilibrium established in modified regions, and (ii) to adopt a more previsional attitude (hypothesis testing) during project planning.","Degallier, Nicolas; Herve, Jean-Pierre; Rosa, Amelia P.

In the first region, one strain was isolated from a pool of 6 Haemagogus janthinomys. In the other region, 2,480 anthropophilous mosquitoes were collected, of which near 40% were potential YF vectors. These species, classified by decreasing relative abundance, were: Aedes scapularis, Sabethes chloropterus, Hg. janthinomys, Hg. leucocelaenus, Hg. spegazinii, and Sa. soperi. Four strains of YF virus were isolated from Hg. janthinomys, one from Sa. cheoropterus (first report for South America) and one from Sa. soperi (first report). The minimal infection rates varied among the three localities of collection but were all high, compared with previous data. The mean daily survival rate was 0.9635 for the populations of Hg. janthinomys, allowing extrapolation of the value of the infection rate when people were infected most recently. It was deduced that the epizootics were intense and more or less concomitant in the three areas.

Along 3 years, the diversity and composition of mosquito species in tree holes of two neighbouring but completely different environments, a city and its adjacent forest, were compared using generalized linear mixed models, PERMANOVA, SIMPER and species association indexes. The city area (Northwest Argentina) is highly relevant epidemiologically due to the presence of Aedes aegypti L. (main dengue vector) and occurrence of dengue outbreaks; the Yungas rainforests are highly biologically diverse. In total seven mosquito species were recorded, in descending order of abundance: Ae. aegypti, Haemagogus spegazzinii Brethes, Sabethes purpureus (Theobald), Toxorhynchites guadeloupensis Dyar and Knab, Aedes terrens Walker, Haemagogus leucocelaenus Dyar & Shannon and Sabethes petrocchiae (Shannon and Del Ponte). The seven mosquito species were recorded in both city sites and forested areas; however, their mosquito communities significantly diverged because of marked differences in the frequency and relative abundance of some species: Tx. guadeloupensis and Ae. aegypti were significantly more abundant in forest and urban areas, respectively. Positive significant associations were detected between Ae. aegypti, Hg. spegazzinii and Hg. leucocelaenus. The combined presence of Ae. aegypti, Haemagogus and Sabethes in the area also highlight a potential risk of yellow fever epidemics. Overall results show an impoverished tree hole mosquito fauna in urban environments, reflecting negative effects of urbanization on mosquito diversity.","Aparicio, J. P.; Gleiser, R.

Outbreaks have been localized and sporadic in the Pan-Amazonia forest since its first isolation in 1954 (Trinidad and Tobago). The literature available is scarce, diverse and dispersed. Mayaro virus is an alphavirus, phylogenetically related to the Semliki forest antigenic complex. UNA and Mayaro viruses are the only viruses of this complex that have been isolated in the New World. Mayaro consists of single-stranded RNA of positive charge, length of 12 kb, subdivided into genomic and subgenomic regions, which encode nonstructural and structural proteins respectively. Mayaro shows a great plasticity in vertebrate host infection, whereas high specificity in the family Culicidae (mosquitoes). Risk factors of infection are associated with forest areas of northern South America and the rainy season. Two genotypes of MAYV have been identified, L (Belterra, Brazil) and D (widely distributed in the Pan- Amazonia). The enzootic cycle is similar to the jungle cycle of yellow fever, which involves Haemagogus mosquitoes and monkeys as reservoirs. However, the involvement of other secondary vectors and other hosts may be important in spread of the virus. Humans may have high levels of viremia, and efficient experimental transmission has been demonstrated in Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Aedes scapularis, suggesting a significant risk to public health in urban, rural and peridomestic locations close to enzootic foci of Mayaro virus.","Carlos Navarro, Juan; Munoz, Manuel","Biomedica","32",201,"","","","","","","","",""

Thirty seven plants were sampled for which the amount of water and some morphological and physicochemical variables were also determined. Twenty eight of macro invertebrates morphospecies were found, 20 of which were Diptera. The order Coleoptera was the most abundant, with 40.5% of the total number of individuals, followed by Diptera and Cladocera, each with approximately 25% of the total individuals. Shannon's diversity index for each plant was between 0.735 and 2.133, and Margalef's richness index was between 1.249 and 3.246. Using a similitud analysis a group of 20 individuals of T. turneri with a similar composition of macro invertebrates was identified. The most abundant functional groups were shredders-piercers represented by the genus Scirtes and collectors-filterers represented by the families Culicidae and Daphnidae. The physicochemical and morphological variables were not related with species richness and diversity of the macro invertebrates community. However, multiple regression for macro invertebrate abundance was significtive, showing that the plant area and the amount of water were the variables that better explained it. Too, the multiple regression indicates that the abundance of Haemagogus and Tanyponinae sp. 1 was explained for the amount water in the plant tank.","Betancur, Julio; Estevez-Varon, Jaime V.; Ospina-Bautista, Fabiola; Realpe-Rebolledo, Emilio","Acta Zoologica Mexicana Nueva Serie","20",200,"","","","","","","","",""

Plants are traditional sources of mosquito repelling essential oils (EOs), glyceridic oils and repellent and synergistic chemicals. A Chemical Abstracts search on mosquito repellent inventions containing plant-derived EOs revealed 144 active patents mostly from Asia. Chinese, Japanese and Korean language patents and those of India (in English) accounted for roughly 3/4 of all patents. Since 1998 patents on EO-containing mosquito repellent inventions have almost doubled about every 4 years. In general, these patents describe repellent compositions for use in topical agents, cosmetic products, incense, fumigants, indoor and outdoor sprays, fibers, textiles among other applications. 67 EOs and 9 glyceridic oils were individually cited in at least 2 patents. Over 1/2 of all patents named just one EO. Citronella [Cymbopogon nardus (L.) Rendle, C. winterianus Jowitt ex Bor] and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus L'Her. spp.) EOs were each cited in approximately 1/3 of all patents. Camphor [ Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J. Presl], cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), clove [ Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L. M. Perry], geranium (Pelargonium graveolens L'Her.), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.), lemon [ Citrus x limon (L.) Osbeck], lemongrass [ Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf] and peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) EOs were each cited in > 10% of patents. Repellent chemicals present in EO compositions or added as pure ""natural"" ingredients such as geraniol, limonene, p-menthane-3,8-diol, nepetalactone and vanillin were described in approximately 40% of all patents. About 25% of EO-containing inventions included or were made to be used with synthetic insect control agents having mosquito repellent properties such as pyrethroids, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), (+/-)-p-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) and dialkyl phthalates. Synergistic effects involving one or more EOs and synthetic and/or natural components were claimed in about 10% of all patents. Scientific literature sources provide evidence for the mosquito repellency of many of the EOs and individual chemical components found in EOs used in patented repellent inventions.","Gama, Renata Antonaci; Lopes, Norberto Peporine; Pohlit, Adrian Martin; Tadei, Wanderli Pedro; de Andrade Neto, Valter Ferreira","Planta Medica","77",201,"","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods: Adult Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes were collected via human landings simultaneously in the canopy and understory of three replicate high forest, white sand forest, and seasonally flooded forest sites near Iquitos, Peru. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded every 15 min. during the collection periods. Results: No Hg. janthinomys were collected in seasonally flooded forest. Their abundance was similar between high forest and white sand forest (Z = 1, 48; p = 0,14), but more individuals were encountered in the canopy (2.9; ± 0.89) than in the understory (0,4; ± 0.23) (Z = 2.80; p = 0,005). Hg. janthinomys abundance was not correlated with temperature or humidity (F1, 14 < 0.33; p 0057; r2 < 0.03). Conclusions: These preliminary results show that around Iquitos as in other regions, Hg. janthinomys are most abundant in the forest canopy. They also suggest that the probability of encountering Hg. janthinomys it can depends both on forest type and height of sampling within forests, but is not a function of temperature and humidity within the ranges commonly encountered in tropical forests.","Lounibos, L.

Eggs were collected using oviposition traps, ""ovitraps,"" in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in October (Experiment 1) and November (Experiment 2), 2015. Thereafter, the eggs were subjected to 16 immersions, to test hatching rate and evaluate the average development time. Hg. leucocelaenus individuals kept in a climate-controlled chamber (28 +/- 1 degrees C) showed an average development period of 10.44 +/- 0.70 d, from the start of larval stage to adulthood. Immersion viability was 49.8% and 18.2% for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In both experiments, the hatching peak occurred during the first immersion, where 26% and 15% of eggs hatched in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. These results provide new insights into the biology of Hg. leucocelaenus.","Alencar, Jeronimo; Maia, Daniele de Aguiar; Tatila-Ferreira, Aline","Entomological news","127",201,"","","","","","","","",""

The first cases were reported 1 week after New Year's day and originated at Chapada dos Veadeiros, a tourist canyon site in Goias state, near Brasilia, the Brazilian capital. The laboratory procedures used for diagnoses included serology with an IgM capture assay and plaque reduction neutralization test, virus isolation in suckling mice and C6/36 cells, and immunohistochemistry. All cases were diagnosed by at least two different laboratory procedures, with the exception of the first three fatal cases, which were diagnosed on the basis of clinical and epidemiological information. The cases were reported in eight Brazilian states as follows: Goias with 64.9% (50 cases); Amazonas (1); Bahia (10); Distrito Federal (1); Mato Grosso (4); Minas Gerais (2); Para (1); Sao Paulo (2),; and Tocantins (6). Patient ages were within the following ranges: 13-74 years old (mean 34.3), 64 (84.4%) were male, especially agricultural workers (n = 30), but tourists (n = 11), carpenters (n = 4), fishermen (n = 4), students (n = 3),, truck drivers (n = 3), and other people (n = 22) were also sickened. The case fatality rate was 50.6% (39/77). In Bahia state, a serologic survey that was carried out has suggested a symptomatic/asymptomatic coefficient of 1:4. Field studies developed in Distrito Federal, Goias, and Sao Paulo states showed that Haemagogus janthinomys was the mosquito species associated with the transmission. A single strain was also obtained from Aedes scapularis in Bahia. Epizootic occurrence (monkey mortality) was observed in 49 municipalities mainly in Goias state, where 40 municipalities made reports, 21 of which also diagnosed human cases. Data obtained: by the NationalInstitute of Meteorology in Brazil showed an increase in temperature and rain in December 1999 and the first 3 months of 2000 in Goias and surrounding states, which perhaps has contributed to the intense and widespread transmission of the yellow fever virus. The relatively small number of cases probably reflects the extensive use of yellow fever 17D-vaccine during the last 3 years, in which about 45 mil:lion doses were used. During the last months of 1999, 16 and 11 yellow fever cases were reported in Tocantins and Goias states, respectively. It is noteworthy that the last reported autochthonous cases of sylvatic yellow fever in Sao Paulo and Bahia, both states outside the endemic/enzootic area, had occurred in 1953 and 1948, respectively.

An investigation was carried out to evaluate the magnitude of the epidemic. In 1993, a total of 932 people was examined for yellow fever from Maranhao: 70 were positive serologically, histopathologically, and/or by virus isolation, and another four cases were diagnosed clinically and epidemiologically. In Mirador (17,565 inhabitants), the incidence was 3.5 per 1,000 people (case fatality rate [number of deaths/number of cases diagnosed] = 16.4%), while in a rural yellow fever risk area (14,659 inhabitants), the incidence was 4.2 and the case-fatality rate was 16.1% (10 of 62). A total of 45.2% (28 of 62) asymptomatic infections were registered. In 1994, 49 serum samples were obtained and 16 cases were confirmed (two by virus isolation, two by seroconversion, and 12 by serology). No fatal cases were reported. In 1993, 936 potential yellow fever vectors were captured in Mirador and a single strain was isolated from a pool of Haemagogus janthinomys (infection rate = 0.16%). In 1994, 16 strains were isolated from 1,318 Hg. janthinomys (infection rate = 1.34%) and one Sabethes chloropterus (infection rate = 1.67%). Our results suggest that this was the most extensive outbreak of yellow fever in the last 20 years in Brazil. It is also clear that the lack of vaccination was the principal reason for the epidemic, which occurred between April and June, during the rainy season, a period in which the mosquito population in the forest increases.","Barros, V.

Two strains of YF virus were isolated in suckling mice from 23 Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus Dyar & Shannon mosquitoes collected from the study sites. The YF virus was isolated from this species in the 1930s in Brazil and in the 1940s in Colombia. No human cases were reported during the current epizootic outbreak. The YF virus isolation and the absence of Hg. (Haemagogus) janthinomys Dyar from the area suggest that Hg. leucocelaenus may be a secondary YF vector and play an important role in the epidemiology of this disease in the Southern Cone.","Mardini, L.
